## Help Out

There are tons of ways to help out.

- continue summarizing candidate bios.
- add candidate districts
- add candidate websites
- add links to candidate youtube channels

Most importantly, help us spread the word and bring people to the app.

## Reach Out

We're 2 months away from the election, so don't be shy. Please reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jasonlaster11).

#### Addendum

- Donate links navigate to Act Blue where appropriate because ActBlue is easier to use, both in terms of contributing and tracking contributions after the fact.

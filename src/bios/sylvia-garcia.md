## A champion for Texas working families

Sylvia Garcia is a dedicated public servant and an experienced leader running for Congress to fight for Texas working families. A lifelong Texan, she grew up as the eighth of ten children in the South Texas farming community of Palito Blanco, working in the cotton fields to help her family get by. While Sylvia’s parents struggled to make ends meet, they taught her that she could do anything with a good education and hard work. Sylvia won a scholarship to Texas Woman’s University, and began her career as a social worker fighting for the most vulnerable members of her community.

- She worked her way through law school at Texas Southern University, and after earning her law degree she went on to serve as director and presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System for an unprecedented five terms under two mayors, fighting to make the city court system more effective and efficient.

- Sylvia was elected Houston **city controller in 1998**, and worked tirelessly to make city government transparent and accountable to working families.

- After two terms, she was elected to the Harris County Commissioner's Court — the first Hispanic and first woman to be elected to that office in her own right — and she has served as the president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.

- In 2013, Sylvia was elected to the Texas state Senate, becoming the seventh woman and the **third Hispanic woman to serve** in that chamber. A resident of Houston, Sylvia has dedicated her career to serving the Harris County community she is proud to call home.

## An experienced leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Sylvia is dedicated to expanding economic opportunity and creating good paying jobs for all hardworking Texas families. She has personally experienced the power of public education to open doors, and she believes in the potential of Texas students. When elected she will be a powerful advocate for policies that give all Texas students and families the opportunity to thrive. Sylvia is a pro-choice champion committed to expanding access to health care, and she has fought back against the Texas Republicans who have stood in the way of expanding Medicaid to help close the coverage gap in Texas. When elected to Congress, she will fight back against Republicans’ desperate attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, and she will work tirelessly to expand all Texans’ access to quality, affordable health care. “As Latinos, we have seen such an anti-immigrant climate in Texas, and the lack of immigration reform has created laws that deny access to Latinos in healthcare, education, housing, voter registration,” Sylvia has said, and when elected, she will bring new leadership to Congress as she continues her lifelong fight for all hardworking Texans.

## An opportunity to make history

Sylvia is running for the open seat currently held by the retiring incumbent Democratic Congressman Gene Green. This dedicated champion for Texas working families is running a strong grassroots campaign and she has what it takes to win. The Lone Star State is home to millions of Latinas, but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress. Sylvia is poised to be one of the first, and she’s fighting tirelessly for the Texans whose voices aren’t being heard in Washington. Let’s show her our full support and give Houstonians and all Texas Latinas a new voice in the halls of power.

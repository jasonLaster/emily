## A groundbreaking candidate and public servant fighting for Minnesota families

Ilhan Omar is a groundbreaking candidate and public servant who is running for Congress to fight for Minnesota working families. When she was a young girl, Ilhan’s family escaped civil war in Somalia, spent several years in a refugee camp in Kenya, and eventually moved to the United States when Ilhan was 12 years old.

She learned English by watching American television shows, and after living in Virginia for a little over two years, her family settled in Minnesota. After graduating from college, Ilhan became politically active, working for state legislative campaigns and as a senior policy aide to a Minneapolis city councilmember.

She then served as the _director of policy and initiatives at Women Organizing Women_, helping to empower East African women to pursue civic leadership opportunities in their communities.

> Ilhan was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016, making history as the first Muslim refugee and first Somali American Muslim woman in elected office in the United States.

She serves as **assistant minority leader in the chamber**, and has received the Rising Star Award from the DFL Women’s Hall of Fame. Ilhan lives in Minneapolis with her husband and three children.

## A champion for equality and opportunity

Ilhan is a champion for her community and believes everyone should have an equal opportunity to succeed. In the state House, she has been an advocate for policies that help working families, such as paid sick leave and increased funding for public schools, and has authored legislation to protect residential renters’ rights. In Congress, she will continue fighting to expand economic opportunity for Minnesotans. “We must build a democratic economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few,” she has said. Ilhan wants to reduce the economic burdens that working families face, and will work to make health care, housing, and higher education more affordable and accessible. “I have proven myself to be someone who shows up, takes on the hard fight and delivers, and I am ready to do that for the people of the 5th Congressional District and the people of our state,” she has said.

## A must-win open seat

Ilhan is running for Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, a seat that we must fight to keep in Democratic hands. Ilhan’s grassroots campaign has received strong support locally and nationally, as she seeks to make history as one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. This district is one that Democrats must win to take back the House. “I know what it feels like to be a young family looking for opportunity in the United States,” she has said, “I am excited to go and be a voice for the voiceless at the Capitol.” EMILY’s List is proud to be supporting this groundbreaking champion for Minnesotans.

## A champion for California working families

Nanette Diaz Barragán is running for re-election to continue her fight to expand economic and educational opportunities for all. The daughter of a factory worker and a TV repairman, Nanette grew up near Carson, CA, the youngest of 11 kids. Nanette’s parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico before she was born — her mother coming to the U.S. with just a third grade education.

Growing up in a community where many of her peers didn’t graduate from high school, Nanette says there was “no real expectation” that she would go to college — and no sense that higher education would be possible for her. But with the urging of her mother, Nanette applied to the University of California-Davis and was accepted.

Nanette worked odd jobs to pay her way through school, transferring to UCLA during her freshman year to be closer to home so she could help support her sick father. After graduating from UCLA, Nanette put herself through law school at the University of Southern California.

Driven by a commitment to helping hardworking families in communities like hers, Nanette has dedicated her career to public service — from working for the NAACP to help address inequalities in health care to her work as a pro bono Spanish-speaking adoption attorney. She became the first Latina ever elected to the Hermosa Beach City Council, and served as the city’s first Latina mayor prior to successfully running for Congress in 2016.


## A fighter dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Nanette is running to continue the fight to expand economic opportunity and to help create good- paying jobs so that all Golden State communities can thrive. Throughout Nanette’s outstanding career of service, she has tackled the toughest challenges facing her community time and time again. A fierce champion for access to quality, affordable health care and for environmental justice, Nanette fights back against any attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. As the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force for Environment, Public Lands and Water, she works to raise awareness of how environmental conditions throughout the country have a disproportionately negative health impacts on communities of color, low-income families, and other marginalized groups. Since taking office, Nanette has been working tirelessly for the people she serves — still in her first term, she has sponsored more than ten bills on issues ranging from homeland security to requiring sexual harassment training for all employees of federal contractors. At a time when working families are under attack from the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans like never before, Nanette has fought courageously on behalf of Californians whose struggles are deeply personal for her — for veterans like her uncle, for DREAMers like her cousin, and for hardworking people like her parents trying to make ends meet. Nanette knows firsthand that with opportunity, all things are possible, and she is committed to making the American dream a reality for all of the families she serves.

## A progressive champion who fought back an unpredictable field

 

## In California’s top-two primary system, two candidates of any party affiliation can advance to the general election — and with these unpredictable dynamics, Nanette still made it through to the general election race. But it’s critical that we continue to give her our dedicated support all the way through November. The EMILY’s List community showed this pro-choice champion our full support in 2016, and now it’s time for us to show her that we have her back as she continues to fight for our progressive values.

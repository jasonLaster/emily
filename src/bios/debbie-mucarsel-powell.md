## A first generation American and a champion for Florida working families

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is running for Congress to ensure that all working families have the opportunity to get ahead that her family had — opportunities that are disappearing in Florida and across the country. Born in Ecuador, _Debbie immigrated to the United States as a young girl_ with her mother and three sisters seeking economic opportunity.

Her mother worked tirelessly as a home health care provider and learned English in night and weekend classes, teaching her that anything is possible in America if you work hard. Debbie started working the early morning shift at a doughnut shop to help her family make ends meet when she was 15 years old, and remained focused on earning the grades she needed to get a college scholarship.

After earning her bachelor’s degree in political science, she worked as an office manager at a shipping company to support herself while earning her **master’s degree in international political economy**.

> She has dedicated her career to improving the lives of all Floridians, helping nonprofits increase access to quality health care for all and fight the effects of climate change.

Debbie and her husband have three school-aged children, and are proud to raise them in the Sunshine State. She is a champion for the Florida working families who need one most, and when elected she will fight to ensure their voices are heard in Congress.

## An experienced community leader fighting to improve health care access in Florida

Debbie is deeply grateful for the opportunities America has given her, and when elected she will work tirelessly to grow our economy and create good-paying jobs to help Florida’s working families thrive. She has worked on finding innovative solutions to serious problems facing her community by building public private partnerships to help fund critical programs. Debbie, a former associate dean at Florida International University, has over a decade of experience working in education. She is dedicated to strengthening public universities and addressing the rising costs of higher education that create barriers for hardworking Floridians doing their best to improve their lives. A pro-choice champion, Debbie will fight back against the GOP’s assault on reproductive health care. Through her work with the Coral Restoration Foundation, Debbie has seen firsthand that Florida cannot wait to act on climate change. In Congress, she will fight back against the extreme Republican agenda that prioritizes special interests at the expense of our climate and our precious natural resources. When elected, Debbie will be a fierce advocate for policies that grow Florida’s economy and preserve its unique environment for generations of residents and visitors to come.

## An outstanding opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Debbie is running against Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo, one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents seeking re-election in 2018. Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump by double digits in Florida’s 26th Congressional District, and our path to taking back the House runs directly through this district and others like it. Curbelo has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to take away health care from millions of Americans — prioritizing special interests and putting at risk the lives of the people he was elected to serve. Curbelo’s Republican allies count on his support for their dangerous agenda, and will spend all they can to keep control over this seat in an expensive media market. This seat is a must-win to take back the majority in the House. The stakes are high for Florida and our country, and Debbie has what it takes to fight back and win. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help her win for Florida’s working families and flip this seat from red to blue.

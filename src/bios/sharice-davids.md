## A dedicated community leader standing up for Kansas working families

Sharice Davids is a dedicated community leader who is running to fight for Kansans in Congress. She was raised by her single mother, who is a U.S. Army veteran, in Leavenworth and learned the value of hard work and service from a young age. As a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, Sharice could make history as the **first Native American woman elected to Congress**. “It wasn't part of my decision. [...] but I'm definitely proud to be part of this time in history,” she has said. Sharice studied business administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and received her law degree from Cornell Law School.

- She worked for a law firm in Kansas City on issues including **economic development for Native American tribes**. She then went on to live and work on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

- Sharice served as a **White House Fellow** during the final year of the Obama administration. Most recently, Sharice hosted a podcast called “Starty Pants,” where she interviewed entrepreneurs and investors. She has also competed in mixed martial arts tournaments, fighting both professionally and as an amateur.

- In addition to making history as the first Native American woman in Congress, Sharice could also be the **first openly gay member of the Kansas congressional delegation** and the first Democratic woman to represent the 3rd District.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Sharice is running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for Kansas working families. “Voters want a representative who speaks and acts for their values, interests, and communities,” she has said. “I have a proven track record of service and will add a new, distinct voice and viewpoint to the nation’s discussions.” Sharice knows that too many Americans and Kansans lack access to quality, affordable health care. She supports the continued expansion of Medicaid and will support legislation that brings down the price of prescription drugs for those who are struggling to afford them. As someone who’s still paying off student loans herself, Sharice is determined to make higher education more affordable for others. “As a woman and a Native American, I know how to stand up and fight for equity,” she has said. “As a lawyer, economic advisor, and advocate, I know how to build consensus and get things done.”

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Sharice is challenging Congressman Kevin Yoder, a vulnerable Republican who has been advancing his party’s dangerous agenda at the expense of the working families he was elected to serve. “Kevin Yoder no longer represents the people of Kansas,” she has said. “He is now a rubber stamp for the Trump administration and the big-money donors who have fueled his campaigns.” This is an opportunity to flip a seat and win back the House for Democrats. Let’s show Sharice the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Kansas working families.

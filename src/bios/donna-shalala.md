## A proven leader dedicated to fighting for others

Donna Shalala has dedicated her career to fighting for others. As the secretary of health and human services (HHS) under President Clinton, Donna led the introduction and implementation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program and helped achieve the highest child immunization rates in U.S. history.

Recently, Donna served as the **president of the Clinton Foundation**, helping carry out the foundation’s efforts to improve public health and increase economic opportunity around the world.

Prior to that role, she was **president of the University of Miami**, where she increased the university’s endowment, expanding private support for student scholarships, academic and research programs, and facilities.

Previous positions include serving as assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Donna has also served as **chair of the Committee on the Future of Nursing** at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and co-chair of the Commission on Care for Returning Wounded Warriors.

Donna has lived in South Florida for the last 17 years.

## A champion for improving access to health care and education

Florida families need a champion now more than ever. With our access to quality health care constantly coming under attack by Congress, Donna’s record of fighting for women and children will enable her to get results that improve people’s lives. “We need deeper subsidies. People are paying too much out of pocket,” she has said. “If you talk to people in our community, they’re paying too much […] for all of their health care, whether it’s public or private health care.” Donna plans to improve access to quality, affordable health care and fight to strengthen Florida’s education system.

## An open seat and key pickup opportunity to flip the House

Donna is running to fill retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s seat – a seat that is considered a key pickup opportunity for Democrats in our fight to take back the House. Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump by nearly 20 points in this district in 2016, and Donna has what it takes to flip this must-win seat. She is a proven leader who is prepared to take her breadth and depth of experience fighting for others to the halls of Congress. EMILY’s List is proud to stand with Donna and show her the full support of our community to turn this red seat blue.

## A first generation American fighting for hardworking Texans

Gina Ortiz Jones is a dedicated public servant running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for hardworking Texans. She grew up in San Antonio, where she and her sister were raised by their single mother who came to the United States from the Philippines in pursuit of the American dream. Gina’s mother had a graduate degree, but arrived in the United States as a domestic helper, and at times needed to take on multiple jobs.

For a time, her family relied on public housing and reduced school lunch to make ends meet, and she learned the value of hard work and humility from the example of her mother’s sacrifices.

Gina saw that education and service offered a pathway to opportunity, and earned an Air Force ROTC scholarship to college.

> After completing her B.A. and an M.A. in Economics, Gina entered the Air Force as an intelligence officer. She deployed to Iraq and served under the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy.

Following her active duty service, Gina has served as a leader in economic and national security issues, most recently as _director of investment at the Office of Services and Investment_ in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

At a time when opportunities are disappearing for families like hers, Gina is running for office for the first time to continue her lifelong fight for Texan working families.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Gina is a first generation American fighting to expand economic and educational opportunities in San Antonio and West Texas. When elected, she will champion policies that help create good paying jobs for hardworking Texans. Gina believes that every Texan student deserves the opportunity to pursue a higher education if they choose—not only if they can afford it. When elected, she will fight back against Republicans’ attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. Gina left the Air Force to return to San Antonio when her mother became ill with colon cancer, and she was grateful that her mother had access to the lifesaving care she needed. As Texas continues to have the highest rate of uninsured Americans and many Texans are just one medical emergency away from bankruptcy, Gina is committed to expanding all Texans’ access to affordable quality health care. “There can be only one incentive: a healthy population,” she has said.

## A trailblazer with an opportunity to flip a seat

Gina is challenging incumbent Congressman Will Hurd, a vulnerable second-term incumbent who has prioritized his party’s extreme agenda over the interests of the working families he was elected to serve. Our path to taking back the House runs right through this district, where Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by more than three points in 2016. “I know his voting record,” Gina has said of Hurd, “and I know his voting record would affect families like mine growing up.” She has what it takes to hold him accountable to the Texans whose health care he has jeopardized and whose families he has voted to tear apart. Gina is a trailblazer, and she’s proud to be a candidate who is “openly gay, openly first generation, openly veteran, openly Asian-American, openly everything,” she has said. “Right now is not the time to be closeted or be ashamed of who you are or who you love.” When elected, she will fight for an inclusive Texas with opportunity for all. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help this champion for hardworking Texas flip a seat from red to blue.

## A fighter for Illinois working families

Betsy Dirksen Londrigan is an Illinois fighter running for Congress to serve the working families of the community that she has proudly called home all her life. An experienced progressive and nonprofit leader, Betsy has **worked for United States Senator Dick Durbin** and served as a fundraiser for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation.

She has worked as a **self-employed entrepreneur** while raising her three children, and is a powerful advocate for small businesses that are the backbone of our economy.

A champion for access to health care, a deeply personal issue for her family, Betsy has worked tirelessly to support children’s hospitals and to raise funds for the Children’s Miracle Network and St. John’s Children’s Hospital.

She was born and raised in Springfield, where she and her husband have raised their three children, adding another generation to their deep family roots in Sangamon County.


## A champion for health care and expanding economic opportunity

Betsy is running to expand economic opportunity and to help create good-paying jobs for downstate Illinois working families. Her immigrant great-grandparents came to Illinois in pursuit of the American dream, and Betsy will fight for all hardworking Illinoisans to have the chance to thrive as they did. She has been fighting to expand access to quality health care since 2009, when her son became critically ill with a rare, serious illness resulting from a tick bite. Betsy’s son had to be put in a medically-induced coma and was hospitalized for 24 days before he started on the long road to recovery. Her family was fortunate to have had health insurance that kept his life-threatening illness from also threatening their economic security, and she has fought tirelessly to ensure that access to health care is a right and not a privilege. “No family should be put in danger of bankruptcy because of an unexpected medical emergency, and people with pre-existing conditions need confidence they will be able to afford their healthcare,” she has said. A strong advocate for all students, Betsy taught seventh and eighth graders as a corps member with Teach For America after college, and she started and directed the alumni association for the University of Illinois-Springfield. A former teacher, she has volunteered extensively with her children’s schools and is dedicated to increasing access to educational opportunities for all students.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Betsy is taking on extreme Republican Congressman Rodney Davis, who has been advancing his party’s dangerous agenda at the expense of the working families he was elected to serve. Davis repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood, voted to undermine equal pay protections for women, and voted for the House Republican health care plan to kick 23 million people off their insurance — threatening the health care coverage of Illinois working families as well as job losses in this district. This seat is a must-win on Democrats’ path to taking back the House, and Betsy has what it takes to flip it from red to blue. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Illinois working families to the U.S. House in 2018.

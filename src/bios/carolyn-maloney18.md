## A proven and effective national leader

Carolyn Maloney is running for re-election to continue her fight to expand economic opportunity for all hardworking New York families.

Carolyn was first **elected to Congress in 1992**, where she’s consistently ranked as one of the top producers of legislation, either as stand-alone bills or incorporated into larger legislation packages.

She is a national leader with accomplishments on security, financial services, the economy and women's issues, from securing health care for those suffering from ailments related to 9/11 to authoring the **Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights**, which, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), has saved consumers more than $16 billion annually since it was signed into law in 2009.

Carolyn is consistently ranked as one of the **most effective leaders** in the House of Representatives: In 2013, she introduced the fifth highest number of bills of all representatives, and in 2015, the bills she authored had **1,202 co-sponsors** — the second most in all of Congress. Carolyn has been a champion in Washington for women and working families for more than two decades.

## A tenacious champion for working families

Carolyn is running to continue her career-long fight to expand economic opportunity so that all of New York’s working families can thrive. She was the first woman to chair the joint economic committee, a House and Senate panel that examines and addresses the nation’s most pressing economic issues — in that role, she became just one of just a handful of women in history to chair a Congressional committee. She is currently a senior member of the House financial services committee, where she has stood up to the credit and banking industries to fight for working families. Carolyn has also been a fierce advocate for health care, from passing legislation that provides annual mammograms for women on Medicare to creating women’s health offices in five federal agencies that were incorporated as part of the landmark Affordable Care Act. Carolyn is a courageous fighter for survivors of sexual violence: She is co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Human Trafficking, and she authored the Debbie Smith Act, which increases funding for law enforcement to process DNA rape kits and has been called “the most important anti-rape legislation in history.” At a time when working families are under attack from the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans like never before, Carolyn is a fearless defender for New Yorkers and all Americans.

## An Empire State leader we cannot take for granted

In 2018, Carolyn is running for re-election — and the stakes for our country are simply too high for us to take her leadership for granted. Fortunately, Carolyn and key members of New York’s legislative leadership are working to position New York as one of the strongest defenses we have against the president’s extreme and divisive agenda — and we need Carolyn to continue leading that defense in Washington. Just as she has always fought for us, let’s show Carolyn the full support of the EMILY’s List community — now more than five million members strong — and help her continue her record of outstanding service for women and families in New York and across the country.

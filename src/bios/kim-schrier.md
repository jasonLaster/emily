## A champion for Washington State working families

Kim Schrier is a pediatrician running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for Washington State working families. The daughter of an elementary school teacher and an aerospace engineer, Kim has understood what it means to worry about health and insurance coverage since she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 16.

- A proud graduate of public schools, including her degrees in astrophysics and medicine, Kim has dedicated her career to improving the lives of her patients and their families. After the 2016 election, Kim marched, protested, and called her elected officials to fight back against the agenda threatening to undo all the progress we’ve worked so hard to make.

- When Republicans began their effort to take away millions of working families’ access to affordable health care, she decided to step up and run for office for the very first time. Kim, her husband, and their son live in Issaquah, the community where she has been serving children and families as a pediatrician for 16 years.

## A pediatrician and community leader fighting for our values

Kim will fight to expand economic opportunity for all Washington State working families. She is running to create good paying jobs and to defend economic security by protecting vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. An advocate for public education and a fighter for all students, she will work tirelessly to help Washington State schools prepare students to succeed in tomorrow’s economy and to make college more affordable. As a medical doctor with 16 years of experience practicing pediatrics in her community, Kim is ready to bring new leadership to Washington. “I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege,” Kim has said, and she will fight back against any attempt to roll back the progress we have made in expanding Americans’ access to affordable care. “As someone with Type 1 diabetes, I know personally what it's like to worry about losing coverage due to a pre-existing condition,” she has said. “TrumpCare would take away health insurance for over 70,000 people in my district.” Kim is a pro-choice champion who will fiercely defend every woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. “Having a woman doctor at the table is an important perspective, especially during discussions of women’s health and reproductive rights,” she has said.

## An opportunity to flip an open seat from red to blue

Kim is running for the highly contested open seat currently held by Republican Congressman Dave Reichert, who opted not to seek re-election less than a month after Kim launched her strong campaign to hold him accountable for voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats’ path to taking back the House runs straight through this district – one of 23 Republican-held districts where Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in 2016. This is a must-win race, and Kim is the only candidate who has what it takes to flip this seat from red to blue. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community, and help send this champion for Washington State working families to Congress.

## An experienced leader and fighter for Nebraska working families

Kara Eastman has been a children's health nonprofit executive and education leader and is running for Congress to fight for Nebraska working families. Raised by a single mother, Kara learned the values of hard work and service to others from her close-knit Midwestern family. She and her husband, a professor, chose Nebraska as their home, and live in Omaha with their daughter. Kara, who began her career as a social worker, is a problem solver dedicated to serving her community.

- In 2006 she founded the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance, an organization that has directly served thousands of Nebraska families and raised millions of dollars to support green, safe, and healthy housing in Omaha.

- In 2014, she was elected to the Board of Governors of Metropolitan Community College, the largest community college in Nebraska, and has served as vice chair. Kara has worked tirelessly to strengthen non-discrimination policies, develop programs that create jobs in the community, and to make all campuses safe, healthy environments where students can thrive.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Kara is a fierce advocate running to expand economic and educational opportunities for all Nebraskans. As president and CEO of the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance she created jobs within the organization and with the small businesses, contractors, and local government agencies that work together to support safe housing for families. She is an experienced education leader dedicated to ensuring that all Nebraskans have access to the educational opportunities that help them get ahead, and when elected she will champion policies that grow our economy by making quality higher education affordable for all. At a time when Republicans are trying to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Kara is committed to fighting back and expanding access to health care for all. This is a deeply personal issue for her: When Kara’s mother was recently undergoing her fifth round of treatment for cancer, she was prescribed a pill that cost $2,500 — on top of the $800 she was already paying out of pocket each month for prescription drugs despite having Medicare. When elected, Kara will bring her focus on innovation and action to Congress as she tackles the toughest problems facing hardworking Nebraskans.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Kara is challenging Congressman Don Bacon, a vulnerable Republican freshman who has prioritized his party’s extreme agenda over the interests of the working families he was elected to serve. Bacon has voted in lockstep with the dangerous Republican agenda, including for the GOP health care plan to kick 23 million people off their insurance — threatening the health care coverage of Nebraska working families. Nebraska has never before elected a Democratic woman to the House, and Kara is poised to be the first. This is an opportunity to flip a seat, and an important race on the path to taking back the House. Let’s show Kara the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Nebraska working families to the U.S. House in 2018.

## A new district and a key pickup opportunity to flip the House

Mary Gay is running in the 5th District, a seat that was newly drawn following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision to overturn an unconstitutional Republican gerrymander that kept working families’ voices from being heard in the halls of power. Hillary Clinton won this district handily in 2016, making it a critical pickup in Democrats’ fight to take back the House. Mary Gay also can give millions of Pennsylvania women a new voice in Washington by changing the face of the state’s congressional delegation, which is currently all men. Let’s show this champion for families the full support of the EMILY’s List community and turn this seat blue.

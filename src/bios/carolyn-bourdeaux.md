## An experienced leader and dedicated public servant

Carolyn Bourdeaux is an experienced leader and dedicated public servant running for Congress to continue her lifelong fight for working families. The daughter of two teachers, Carolyn won grants and took out federal loans to work her way through college at Yale and went on to earn a master’s degree in public administration from the University of Southern California as well as a Ph.D. in public administration with a focus on public finance from Syracuse University.

She served as **director of Georgia’s Senate Budget and Evaluation Office**, where she advocated for policies that put taxpayer dollars to work in ways that improve Georgians’ lives. Carolyn has worked on projects to improve public transportation and land use, which laid the groundwork for the Livable Communities Initiative that has revitalized many downtown communities.

Carolyn was most recently a **professor at Georgia State University** and lives in Suwanee with her husband and their young son. When elected, Carolyn will fight tirelessly for hardworking Georgia families.

## A fighter for Georgia working families

Carolyn is running to continue her lifelong fight to expand economic opportunity so that all of Georgia’s working families can thrive. She helped the state of Georgia navigate the challenges of the Great Recession, and the Georgia Senate honored her work with a Senate resolution. For Carolyn, the fight for affordable health care is personal: she lost both of her parents last summer after her father struggled with a long illness. She saw their discretionary income eaten up paying for medications. Carolyn is passionate about making it easier for families like hers to care for aging parents and to increase access to affordable health care for all. When elected, she will give hardworking Georgia families a powerful new voice in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Carolyn is challenging Republican Rob Woodall, an extremist who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away his constituents’ access to health care. Woodall supports policies that would raise costs for people with cancer, diabetes, and pre-existing conditions, putting special interests ahead of the Georgians he was elected to serve. President Trump carried this district by just six points in 2016, making it a prime opportunity for Democrats in 2018, and Carolyn has what it takes to flip it from red to blue. Let’s show Carolyn the full support of the EMILY’s List community to help elect this champion for Georgia working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

## A fighter for Virginia working families

Elaine Luria is an experienced leader and a dedicated public servant running for Congress to fight for Virginia's working families. A graduate of the United States **Naval Academy**, she served our country in uniform for 20 years. Elaine was deployed around the world as a **surface warfare officer and nuclear engineer**, working tirelessly to enforce sanctions, operate nuclear reactors, and oversee complex weapons systems.

She retired from the U.S. Navy in 2017 with the rank of commander, and **started a small business** from her kitchen table that has grown to create jobs in her community and support local organizations for youth and the arts. Elaine is a powerful advocate for Virginia military families.

In 2017, she helped Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring launch the Military and Veterans Legal Guide, a new resource for military families and veterans who are often targets for fraud.

Elaine and her husband Robert, who retired after 27 years of naval service, have lived in Norfolk for nearly twenty years and are proud to raise their daughter in the diverse and vibrant community they are proud to call home.


## A leader dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Elaine is running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for all Virginia working families and to help create good-paying jobs. A successful entrepreneur and community leader, Elaine serves as an elected member of the Hampton Roads Retail Alliance board, working tirelessly to help small businesses grow the Tidewater region’s local economy. She is a pro-choice champion committed to expanding access to affordable, quality health care, and she will fight back against attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. “Security means that we are healthy — and have reliable and affordable choices in healthcare,” Elaine has said. Elaine dedicated her career to public service to build a safer, stronger, and fairer society for this generation and the next, and as an engineer, she will fight back against the dangerous anti-science agenda that threatens our future. “Security means that we must protect our environment — so that we, along with future generations, can breathe fresh air and drink clean water,” she has said. When elected, Elaine will be a fierce advocate for hardworking Tidewater families in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Elaine is challenging vulnerable freshman Republican incumbent Congressman Scott Taylor, and she has what it takes to hold him accountable for his record of failing Virginia families. This district, home to the world’s largest naval base and many hardworking military families, is ready for new leadership, and Elaine is ready to get the job done. This is an opportunity to flip a seat, and a critical race on the path to flipping the House. Let’s show Elaine our full support and help this champion for Virginia working families flip this seat — and let’s take back the House.

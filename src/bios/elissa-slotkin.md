## A dedicated public servant

Elissa Slotkin is a **national security leader** and a life-long public servant running for Congress to fight for Michigan working families. Following the 9/11 attacks, Elissa was recruited to join the Central Intelligence Agency as a Middle East analyst.

Working alongside the U.S. military, Elissa served a total of three tours in Iraq over a span of five years. Elissa has held a variety of defense intelligence roles – under both President Bush and President Obama – at the White House, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the State Department, and the Pentagon.

She currently runs a small business consulting on national security and government affairs. In her final role in government, Elissa served as the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, where she managed a 700-person organization with a $140 million budget, and was the principal advisor to the secretary of defense on security strategy and policy issues related to NATO, Russia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere.

In Baghdad, she met her husband Dave, a now-retired colonel who served in the U.S. Army for 30 years. She currently lives on her family farm in Holly, Michigan, and runs a small business consulting on national security and government affairs.


## A champion for Michigan working families

Elissa, a third-generation Michigander, grew up in a meat-packing family, who taught her the importance of hard work. Elissa spent her early life on a farm, and the Michigan values she learned early in life are the values that have helped her succeed in her career of service and as a Michigan small business owner. When elected, she will bring her straightforward, commonsense approach to Congress tackling the toughest problems facing hardworking families. She will fight tirelessly to expand economic opportunity for all Michiganders and to help create good-paying jobs. Elissa is a powerful advocate for expanding access to health care and pushing back on predatory drug pricing. When elected she will fight back against Republicans’ attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make will champion policies that help move Michigan forward for all working families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Elissa is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Mike Bishop, an extremist with a record that has hurt hardworking Michigan families. Donald Trump only narrowly outperformed Hillary Clinton here, and in 2018 we must win in this district and in others like it to take back the House. Elissa is mounting a serious campaign and she has what it takes to win in 2018—but Bishop’s special interest allies rely on his vote to take away Americans’ health insurance and to reform our tax code to benefit the wealthy few, and they will try to stop Elissa from holding him accountable to Michiganders in 2018. Let’s show Elissa our full support and ensure that she’ll have the resources she needs to take Bishop on and flip this seat from red to blue.

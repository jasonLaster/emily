## A champion for California working families

Norma Torres is running for re-election to continue her fight to expand economic opportunity for all. A longtime resident of Pomona, Norma immigrated to the United States from Guatemala when she was five and has dedicated her career to serving her community.

Norma was inspired to run for public office while she was working as a **911 dispatcher** and sought to address the lack of Spanish-speaking dispatchers in the role.

After unseating a longtime incumbent on the Pomona City Council, Norma **became the city’s first Latina mayor**.

She went on to serve in the California state Assembly and state Senate before she was elected to Congress in 2014. Norma is a champion for schools, quality health care, veterans, and working families’ economic security.

## A fighter for expanding economic opportunity

Norma has fought to expand economic opportunity for all and create good-paying jobs because she understands that too many working families continue to struggle to get by in Southern California and around our country. She introduced the JOBS Act to expand job training opportunities for displaced workers and the Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act, a bill to expand funding for public infrastructure projects, following a job creation listening tour of her community. As a former member of the homeland security committee, Norma cares deeply about making our communities safer and has introduced and advocated for legislation that would do so.

## A critical hold in the fight for control of the House

This seat is a critical hold race and Norma needs our full support in this must-win race for the majority. The EMILY’s List community is proud of Norma’s continued community advocacy, and is thrilled to support her as she continues fighting for hardworking Southern California families.

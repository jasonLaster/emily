## A champion for New Hampshire women and families

Annie Kuster was born and raised in Concord, New Hampshire. Her mother, Susan McLane, served in the state Senate and was a pioneer for women in Granite State politics; her father, Malcolm McLane, was a WWII veteran and POW who served as Concord mayor and as a New Hampshire executive councilor — and both taught Annie the importance of public service.

She worked as an **adoption attorney** for 25 years, and she has said that she “witnessed the extraordinary courage and compassion of women” facing unplanned pregnancy. “Not once did I believe that the government should interfere with their personal and private decision,” Annie has said. “In fact, I believe in less government interference in people's personal lives, including whom to marry, when and whether to bear a child and how to raise kind and compassionate children.”

She is a longtime community activist, and has served on the boards of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, New Hampshire Public Radio, the Capitol Center for the Arts, and Child, and Family Services of New Hampshire. Annie and her husband Brad live in Hopkinton, where they raised their two sons.

In 2012 she defeated an incumbent Republican to become the first woman to represent New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District. During her first term she also made history as part of the **nation’s first all-women delegation**. Annie works tirelessly to increase economic opportunity for Granite Staters, and she is committed to breaking through gridlock in Congress to get results for the women and families she serves.


## An experienced leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Annie’s top priority is fighting to expand economic opportunity for all hardworking Granite State families and to help create good paying jobs. She has fought for legislation to help small businesses create jobs, hosted job fairs in New Hampshire, and her first bill in Congress aimed to cut taxes for New Hampshire employers who provide job training for students. She champions policies that defend working families’ economic security, including paid family and medical leave, raising the minimum wage, and increasing access to affordable, quality childcare. She is a strong advocate for college affordability, and prior to serving in Congress she helped create a program that makes it easier for New Hampshire families to save for their children’s education. “Keeping higher education within the reach of every young person who is willing to work hard is not just important for students, it’s important for our entire economy,” she has said. A champion for expanding access to health care, Granite Staters can count on Annie to fiercely defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. She is fighting back against Republicans’ reckless attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Annie is a longtime pro-choice champion. “I will continue to fight for women's health services at the federal level,” she has said, “and I urge my colleagues not to let such extremist, partisan games interfere with ensuring women across the country can access the health services they need and deserve.” As a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Annie works to ensure our veterans have access to the resources and support they need. She helped pass a package of legislation, including her own bill, to help eliminate the claims backlog for VA benefits, and her efforts to strengthen VA whistleblower protections have been signed into law. Annie has examined current pain management practices within the Veterans’ Administration and its connection to the ongoing opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, and she serves as founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic.

## A critical hold in the fight to control the House

Annie is a fighter who has what it takes to win tough races in the perennial battleground Granite State. In 2016, Annie became the first Democrat from New Hampshire’s deep purple 2nd District to be elected to a third term in the House. This is a swing district where Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by a razor-thin margin last cycle, and the GOP is eyeing it for takeover in their desperate attempts to keep control of the House. Annie is fighting for New Hampshire working families and running a strong grassroots campaign, but in this unpredictable swing district she needs our continued support to fend off a Republican challenge. This seat is a critical hold race in the battle to control the House, and Annie needs our full support in this must-win race for the majority. The EMILY’s List community is proud of Annie’s continued leadership, and is thrilled to support her as she keeps fighting to move New Hampshire forward.

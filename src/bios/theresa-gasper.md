## A powerful advocate working to expand economic opportunity

Theresa is running to expand economic opportunity for all hardworking Ohio families and to help create good-paying jobs in the Dayton area. “So many people in our community are struggling, through no fault of their own, but because policies are in place that make it difficult for them to stay afloat, let alone get ahead,” Theresa has said. “I want to live in a community where everyone has the chance to thrive.” When her father lost his job at the age of 55, she saw firsthand how changes in our economy hurt Ohio families. He found work at local hardware store before going on to buy and run a framing shop. Inspired by his grit, Theresa will fight tirelessly for every Ohioan to have the opportunity to succeed. “Our elected officials need to look out for the economic interests of all constituents, not just the few,” she has said. When elected, she will give Ohio working families a powerful new voice in Washington.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Theresa is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Mike Turner, an out-of-touch extremist whose agenda hurts the working families he was elected to serve. This is an opportunity to flip a seat, and an important seat on the path to flipping the House. Theresa is running a grassroots campaign engaging new voters across the district that can serve as a model for how to make the entire state bluer as she takes this seat from the Republicans for the people of the 10th District. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Ohio working families to the U.S. House in 2018.

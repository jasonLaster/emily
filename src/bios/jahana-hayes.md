## An award-winning teacher fighting for Connecticut working families

Jahana Hayes is a teacher and community leader running for Congress to fight for Connecticut working families. A lifelong Connecticut resident, she grew up in a Waterbury public housing project. Jahana’s family struggled with poverty and addiction.

After she got pregnant as a teenager she found her calling as a teacher and overcame barriers to break the cycle of poverty with the support of her community. She enrolled in her local community college and went on to earn her bachelor’s, master’s, and advanced degrees all while working to support her family.

Jahana has dedicated her career to public education, and worked as a high school social studies teacher in New Haven and Waterbury. A champion for students and their families, Jahana earned the 2016 Connecticut Teacher Of The Year Award and went on to earn the **2016 National Teacher of the Year Award**.

Jahana currently serves as talent and professional development supervisor for Waterbury Public Schools, and lives in Wolcott with her husband, a police officer, and is a proud mother of four children.


## A proven leader dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Jahana is running to expand economic opportunity and to help create good-paying jobs for hardworking Nutmeggers. She has personally experienced the power of public education, and she is a powerful advocate for expanding access to educational opportunity to help families and communities thrive. At a time when Republicans in Congress are desperate to undo all the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Jahana is a fierce advocate for expanding access to quality health care. “I believe that we have an obligation to each other to do better for not only our own families but all families,” she has said.

## A must-win hold critical in the fight to take back the House

Jahana is running to fill an open seat vacated by former Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty. She is running a strong grassroots campaign and won a highly competitive Democratic primary. Jahana has what it takes to win and deliver this must-win seat for Democrats to take back the House in November, but the GOP is sure to do everything they can to flip this seat as they desperately attempt to maintain the majority. There are currently no people of color in New England’s congressional delegation, and Jahana is poised to change that. Connecticut has never elected an African American woman to Congress, and she is poised to be the first. When elected Jahana will be a powerful advocate for the Nutmeggers who are not currently seated at the table in Washington. The EMILY’s List community is proud to stand with this champion for progress in her fight to represent Connecticut working families in Washington.

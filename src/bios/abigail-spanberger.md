## A champion for Virginia working families

Abigail Spanberger is an experienced leader and a deeply committed public servant running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for Virginia working families. She grew up in Henrico County, Virginia, and is a proud graduate of the University of Virginia.

- **Focused on counterterrorism**, she recruited and developed spies and provided the critical intelligence that policymakers needed to make national security decisions to keep our country safe.

- She went on to work in the private sector as a strategic leader helping colleges and universities diversify their student bodies, increase graduation rates, and expand students’ access to affordable educational opportunities.

- Abigail was appointed to the Virginia Fair Housing Board by former Governor Terry McAuliffe in 2017 and has worked to protect Virginians from housing discrimination.

## A fighter working to expand economic opportunity

Abigail is running to expand economic opportunity for all hardworking Virginians and to help create good-paying jobs. She is fighting to protect the economic security of Virginia working families and to defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. Abigail decided to run for Congress after listening to a friend share her fears over the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Abigail’s friend – the father of a child with a genetic disorder – feared not just bankruptcy over medical bills but also losing access to the life-saving care her child needed. A first-time candidate, Abigail has said: “I realized that any fear or apprehension I had related to publicly campaigning, or putting myself out there…that was absolutely nothing compared to the fear that my friends feel when they think about what the future holds for their daughter.” When elected, Abigail will fight tirelessly to ensure that everyone in this country has access to affordable, quality health care.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Abigail is challenging vulnerable Republican incumbent Congressman Dave Brat, a dangerous extremist trying to defend his record of failure to the Virginians he was elected to serve. He has voted to take away health care from millions of people, refused to face constituents who disagree with him, and gained notoriety last year when he was caught on camera complaining that “the women are in my grill no matter where I go.” Abigail is mounting a strong campaign to hold Brat accountable in a district with a powerful grassroots movement of Virginians ready to send him packing. She has what it takes to fight back and win, and to lead Virginia forward for working families. Let’s show Abigail our full support and help her flip this seat and take back the House.

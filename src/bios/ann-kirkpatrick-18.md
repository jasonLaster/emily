## A champion for Arizona’s working families

Ann Kirkpatrick is running for Congress in Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District to continue her lifelong fight to expand economic opportunity for working families.

Born and raised in the Copper State, Ann’s earliest roots are in the small timber town of McNary and on the White Mountain Apache Nation, where her father ran the general store and her mother taught school. Ann worked her way through the University of Arizona, earning her bachelor’s degree and law degree.

She has served Arizonans as a **public school teacher**, **prosecutor**, **state legislator**, **congresswoman**, and **candidate for the U.S. Senate** in a tough 2016 race.

Through it all, Ann has never stopped living her Arizona values of hard work and resilience, working across the aisle to find commonsense solutions and get the job done for working families. She and her husband Roger live in Tucson, near their children and grandchildren.

## A leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Ann has over three decades of experience fighting to ensure that all Arizonans have access to high-quality education, work at a good-paying job, and may raise their families in safe, thriving communities. She puts practicality over politics, and has even cosponsored legislation with a conservative Republican who once ran against her when they found common ground on a bill to bring more jobs to Arizona. This champion for women and families has been fighting back against Republicans’ dangerous agenda to roll back progress. In Congress, Ann fiercely defended the right of Arizona women to make their own reproductive health care decisions, cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and stood up to Republicans seeking to defund Planned Parenthood. She has been a strong advocate for the most vulnerable Arizonans, fighting for a cost-of-living adjustment to help get seniors through the recession and introducing bipartisan legislation to clear the backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

## A chance to flip an open seat from red to blue

Ann is running for an open seat in a true toss-up district where Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nearly five points in 2016. This seat is one of our best flip opportunities, and is a must-win ​in our fight to take back the House. Ann has always put Arizonans first and she is ready to bring her leadership back to Congress. Ann is determined to flip this seat, and she needs the full support of the EMILY’s List community. The GOP will do everything they can to hold on to this seat, but Ann never backs down from a tough fight — and with our help she will win it back for Arizona’s working families.

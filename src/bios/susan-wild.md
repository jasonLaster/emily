## A champion for Pennsylvania working families

Susan Wild is an experienced community advocate running for Congress to fight for Pennsylvania working families. Susan grew up in a military family, moving frequently, but found home when she moved to the Lehigh Valley more than 30 years ago.

An **experienced attorney**, she has dedicated her career to advocating for fairness and equal justice in her practice that includes health care, civil rights, and employment law.

In 2015, the Allentown city council unanimously confirmed her appointment to serve as **city solicitor**, a position that had never before been held by a woman, and accountability and transparency have increased under her leadership.

> Susan has served her community on the boards of her local food bank, regional theater, and Jewish federation. She is the proud mother of two grown children, has two dogs, and supports local animal rescue organizations.

## A leader working to expand economic opportunity

Susan is running to expand economic opportunity for all Lehigh Valley working families, and to help create good-paying jobs so that communities thrive. “Today, anyone who is willing to work should have the chance to, and our political leaders have a responsibility to ensure Pennsylvanians benefit from the country’s economic growth,” she has said. Susan is dedicated to expanding all Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care, and she will fight back against any attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. “In the wealthiest nation on earth, no citizen should have to take on a second job, risk bankruptcy, or make a choice between putting food on the table or buying school supplies, and paying for health care,” she has said. At a time when the laws protecting our clean air and clean water are under attack, Susan is a fierce advocate for protecting the environment. When elected, she will defend our precious natural resources and public lands, and she will fight back against the dangerous anti-science Republican agenda.

## An opportunity to win a new district and take back the House

Susan is running in Pennsylvania’s newly-drawn 7th District, an open seat created in February when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned an unconstitutional Republican gerrymander that kept working families’ voices from being heard in the halls of power. Hillary Clinton narrowly outperformed Donald Trump in this district in 2016, and Susan has what it takes to win this high-stakes fight for a new seat in a state that Republicans disproportionally represent. Pennsylvania currently has the largest congressional delegation that is all men, and when elected, Susan will give millions of Pennsylvania women a new voice in Washington. Let's show Susan the full support of the EMILY’s List community as she fights to give Pennsylvania women and families a powerful new voice in Congress — and let’s take back the House.

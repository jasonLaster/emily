## A dedicated public servant fighting for Granite State working families

Maura Sullivan is a **Marine veteran** and experienced leader running for Congress to fight for New Hampshire working families. She began her career of service as a young woman in ROTC with the encouragement of her public high school guidance counselor. Maura hadn’t seen many women in the military and is grateful to have had the support she needed to envision and begin this path of service. “Becoming a Marine officer was the best decision I made in my life,” she has said. “It was a transformational experience. Simply put, I would not be the person I am today if I had not done it.”

> Maura served in the Marine Corps for five years in East Asia and Fallujah, Iraq, rising to the rank of captain before she went on to earn an MBA and an MPA from Harvard.

After graduate school she worked as a New England manager for a food and beverage company. In 2010 Maura **joined the Obama administration**, first serving on the American Battle Monuments Commission, then as an _assistant secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs_ during a time of crisis, and then in the Pentagon.

Maura felt her fellow Marines were like family, and “I went through a pretty difficult time when I left the Marine Corps community, as a lot of veterans do,” she has said. After her service in the Obama administration, she found community again in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she and her fiancé bought their first home to put down roots and raise a family.

## An experienced leader dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Maura is running to expand economic opportunity and to help create good-paying jobs for Granite Staters. She is a fierce advocate for working families, and she never backs down from a tough fight — especially when the stakes are high. “I saw firsthand in Iraq the consequences female servicemembers faced when women weren’t in the rooms in Washington making decisions impacting their lives. Years later, I was the woman under 40 in the room at the Pentagon, going toe-to-toe with generals, fighting for 12 weeks of maternity leave, not four, and we won that fight,” Maura has said. “We fought for a female soldier’s right to preserve her fertility before she goes into combat, and we won that fight. We fought for gender equity in the military, because if women can meet the bar, if a woman can meet a standard, then she should have the opportunity to serve in every position on the front lines of our country. And we won that fight, too. We will keep fighting, to make women’s rights human rights everywhere.” She is committed to expanding access to health care, and she will fight back against all attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. At a time when the opioid epidemic is devastating New Hampshire families and communities, Maura has what it takes to get the full weight of our federal government behind programs that save lives and prevent tragedies.

## An open seat and a critical Democratic hold in the fight to take back the House

Maura is running for the open seat currently held by retiring Democratic Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter. Donald Trump outperformed Hillary Clinton by fewer than two percentage points here in 2016, and Republicans have targeted this district as a prime takeover opportunity as they desperately defend their majority in 2018. This is a perennial swing seat in a deep purple district, and Maura has what it takes to take on the GOP and win in November at a time when the stakes for Granite State working families couldn’t be higher. “I’ve never seen a more critical moment in our country, a bigger threat to our democracy and to our nation than the moment we are in right now,” Maura has said. “I think the fundamental principles of this country that our country was founded on are at stake. And I simply couldn’t sit on the sidelines so I didn’t hesitate.” Let’s show this champion for working families the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help send her to Congress to fight for Granite Staters.

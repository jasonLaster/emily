## A champion for Colorado’s working families

Diane Mitsch Bush is running for Congress to expand economic opportunities for Colorado’s working families. She most recently served five years in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a vocal proponent of strengthening public education, improving access to affordable health care, protecting public lands, and more.

She previously served as a **Routt County commissioner**, working on issues important to rural Colorado including water rights, internet broadband access, transportation funding, and affordable housing.

Prior to serving as an elected official, she was a **professor at Colorado Mountain College and Colorado State University**.

Diane has called Steamboat Springs her home for over 40 years and currently lives there with her husband, with whom she loves to ski, mountain bike, and rock climb.

## A former public servant and educator dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Diane is deeply committed to expanding economic opportunity for rural Coloradans, improving access to affordable health care, and investing in public education. A former educator herself, Diane understands how important high quality public education is in improving the next generation’s economic outcomes. “I believe that high quality public education is the key to opportunity, because it was for me,” she has said. Diane also recognizes the need to invest in job training programs to prepare Colorado’s workers for today’s economy. “I have supported bills to help businesses create good jobs and provide workforce training, including apprenticeships,” she has said. Diane’s commitment to these values will guide her in being a strong voice for Colorado in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat in a deep purple state

Diane is running to flip the 3rd District, which includes Pueblo, the San Luis Valley, and the Western Slope. Diane is running to face incumbent Republican Congressman Scott Tipton, who has voted for President Trump’s disastrous agenda nearly 100 percent of the time, including to take away affordable health care. Coloradans deserve a new voice representing their best interests in Washington, and Diane has proven that she will be that representative. Let’s show her our full support so that hardworking families in the 3rd District will finally have a representative in Congress who speaks for them.

## A fighter for California working families

Katie Hill is a community leader and fighter running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for hardworking California families. The daughter of a police officer and a nurse, Katie volunteered in a local hospital as a college student to learn about nursing — but her experience comforting patients and their families inspired her to pursue a career tackling the problems that health care alone couldn’t fix.

She joined an organization that serves members of her community experiencing homelessness and she was instrumental in its growth into a statewide organization. Until stepping down recently to campaign full time, Katie served as Deputy **CEO and Executive Director**.

She **oversaw hundreds of government contracts** and partnered with public and private agencies across the state to better serve the needs of the most vulnerable Californians. This experience makes her perfectly suited to be a good steward of California tax dollars and smart government spending.

A lifelong resident of California’s 25th Congressional District, Katie lives in Agua Dulce with her husband on their farm for rescue animals.


## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Katie is running to expand economic opportunity, to help create good paying jobs, and to fight for California's working families. When elected, she will champion policies that give all Californians the chance to thrive. As a lifelong Californian, Katie knows firsthand how seriously high housing costs threaten Golden State families' economic security, and when elected, she will fight tirelessly to increase housing affordability for working families. Katie is a powerful advocate for increasing all Californians’ access to health care, and through her life’s work serving people experiencing homelessness she has seen how health care — including mental health care services and addiction treatment — can transform the lives of the most vulnerable members of our communities. When elected, she will fight back against Republicans’ attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make — and she will work tirelessly to move California forward for all working families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Katie is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Steve Knight, an extremist who has spent his time in office advancing a dangerous agenda that hurts the hardworking families he was elected to serve. Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump by nearly seven points in this district in 2016, and this race is a must-win on our path to taking back the House. Katie is running a strong campaign, and she has what it takes to hold Knight accountable for his record of failure. The GOP won’t give this seat up without a fight, and she needs our help to win this high-stakes races. Let’s show Katie our full support and help send this champion for California working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House in 2018.

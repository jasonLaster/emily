## A fighter for Texas working families

Lizzie Pannill Fletcher is a community leader and fierce advocate running for Congress to fight for Texas working families. Lizzie is a lawyer who has dedicated her career to representing diverse Houstonians who face many different challenges.

**She co-founded Planned Parenthood Young Leaders in 2000**, and has helped recruit a new generation of leaders to fight for the vital health care provider.

As a volunteer attorney, Lizzie has _worked to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline in Texas_, fighting to promote social and economic justice for all students.

> She is dedicated to helping young Houstonians find their voices, and serves on the boards of organizations that create opportunities for students to learn and grow through dance and writing.

A fifth-generation Houstonian, Lizzie has deep roots in this city that she said “welcomes newcomers from around the world, that prides itself on scientific discovery, that serves as a hub of innovation, and that takes care of its neighbors.” Lizzie and her husband are proud to call Houston their home.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Lizzie has dedicated her career to working “for real Houstonians, with real problems, who need real solutions,” she has said, and she’s running for Congress to expand economic opportunity and help create good paying jobs for hardworking Texans. At a time when Republicans are desperate to undo all the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Lizzie will fiercely defend Texans’ access to affordable health care. Lizzie is a pro-choice champion who first became politically engaged as a teenager during the 1992 Republican National Convention, when she volunteered to protect reproductive health care clinics from anti-choice protesters attempting to block patients from entering. She is a powerful advocate for Gulf Coast communities that are fighting to recover from the devastation Hurricane Harvey caused, and when elected she will make their voices heard in Congress. “Scientists and business leaders in Houston agree that climate change is real,” Lizzie has said. “We need leaders who understand the threat of our changing climate and those willing to work with our allies around the world to find ways to address its devastating effects.”

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Lizzie is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman John Culberson, an extremist who has spent his nine terms in office prioritizing a dangerous agenda that hurts the working families he was elected to serve. Our path to taking back the House runs straight through this district where Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in 2016. This seat has been under Republican control ever since George H.W. Bush won it in 1966, but the rapidly changing demographics of the vibrant Houston area have dramatically changed the political landscape here in recent years. Let’s show her grassroots campaign our full support and elect this champion for Texas working families — and take back the House.

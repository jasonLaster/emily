## A champion for Illinois working families

Lauren Underwood is a champion for Illinois working families running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for all. She is a registered nurse with hands-on experience in our health care system and an experienced leader who has dedicated her career to expanding all Americans’ access to quality, affordable care.

When she was 8 years old, Lauren discovered that she had a heart condition — and the health care providers who treated and helped her manage her condition inspired her to pursue a career in nursing.

President Obama appointed Lauren to serve as a **senior advisor at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)**, where she helped communities across the country prevent, prepare for, and respond to disasters, bioterror threats, and public health emergencies.

Lauren worked tirelessly to help implement the Affordable Care Act — broadening access for those on Medicare, improving health care quality, and reforming private insurance for working families across the country.

She currently **works for a Medicaid-managed health care plan** in Chicago, working with clinical staff to ensure the plan provides high-quality, cost-efficient care to Illinois families.

> Lauren also teaches a graduate-level nursing course future helping to grow the next generation of nurse practitioners.

She lives in Naperville, Illinois — the community where she is proud to have grown up and attended public schools.

## A fighter dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Lauren is dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for all Illinoisans and to creating good-paying jobs so that hardworking families and their communities can thrive. As someone with a pre-existing condition, Lauren knows firsthand what’s at stake as we defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make in expanding access to quality, affordable health care. This registered nurse, teacher, pro-choice champion, and public servant has the experience and determination to fight back against the GOP’s dangerous agenda that threatens Illinois’ working families’ access to affordable health care. “I am proud of serving our country by implementing the Affordable Care Act and expanding access to health coverage for millions of Americans,” Lauren has said, “and I was honored to be appointed by President Obama to serve as a Senior Policy Advisor at HHS, working to bolster our disaster response and preparedness and to ensure that our communities were safe, healthy, and resilient.” When elected, Lauren will fight tirelessly to move Illinois forward for all working families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Lauren is running against Republican incumbent Congressman Randy Hultgren, an extremist who has repeatedly sought to throw millions of Americans off their health insurance, puts special interests ahead of the hardworking families he was elected to serve, and denies the existence of climate change. Illinois’ 14th District has never before been represented by a woman or an African American in Congress, and Lauren has what it takes to win and make history. Illinois working families are ready to hold Hultgren accountable for his record of failure, and this race is a must-win on the path to taking back the House in 2018. Let’s show Lauren our full support, and help elect this champion for Illinois working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

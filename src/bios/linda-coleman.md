## A champion for North Carolina working families

Linda Coleman is a proven leader running for Congress to fight for North Carolina working families. A lifelong North Carolinian, she grew up in a family of ten children and worked in tobacco fields as a teenager to pay for school clothes.

Linda began her career as a **public school teacher**, driven by a passion for public service. She was elected to the Wake County Board of Commissioners in 1998 and went on to become the first African American woman to serve as chair when she was unanimously elected to lead the board in 2001.

Linda went on to be elected to three terms in the **North Carolina House of Representatives** and to serve North Carolina as the **Director of the Office of State Personnel** from 2009 to 2012.

She currently serves as a _trustee of Wake Technical Community College_ and is a powerful advocate for all North Carolina students and families. Linda is the proud mother of two children and grandmother of two.


## A fierce advocate for expanding economic opportunity

Linda is running to expand economic opportunity for North Carolina working families and to help create good-paying jobs that make communities thrive. The challenges she and her family faced early in her life inspired her to fight for all North Carolinians to have the opportunity to make better lives for themselves. As an educator, Linda is dedicated to increasing access to quality public education and expanding opportunities for North Carolinians to develop the professional skills they need to succeed in tomorrow’s economy. She is a tireless champion for expanding access to quality health care. At a time when Republicans are desperate to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Linda is committed to fighting back and moving North Carolina forward for working families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue and take back the House

Linda is challenging Republican George Holding, a vulnerable incumbent who has been working to advance the GOP’s agenda that hurts the working families he was elected to serve. Holding has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to defund Planned Parenthood, and has avoided facing the North Carolina families he represents in person at town hall meetings. Linda has what it takes to hold him accountable and win in November. Let’s show this champion for working families our full support and help her flip this seat — and let’s take back the House.

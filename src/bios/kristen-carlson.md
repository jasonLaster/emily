## A fighter for economic fairness and opportunity

Kristen Carlson is a committed fighter for justice who is running for Congress to expand economic fairness and opportunity for Floridians. As former legal counsel for the Florida Department of Citrus, Kristen fought to protect Florida’s orange industry from wrongful business practices by out-of-state companies. She is a respected expert in food law and has held leadership positions at the National Juice Products Association and the Florida Citrus Processors Association. Her broad legal background also includes positions at the Florida Department of Transportation and in private practice. Kristen has also been actively involved in her community, serving on the board of the Lakeland Boys and Girls Club and helping start a nonprofit to encourage millennial voting. Kristen was raised in a military family and grew up moving around the world before attending college and law school in Florida. She then settled in Lakeland, where she has lived for nearly four decades and raised two sons.

## A champion for Florida working families

Kristen will be a voice for Florida working families in Congress, where her top priorities will include protecting access to quality, affordable health care, expanding economic opportunity, and fighting climate change. Her legal experience fighting for economic fairness will guide her in standing up for Floridians. “I’ve tried to make Florida a better place by working with others to get results, and I’m going to take the same approach to Congress,” she has said.

## An open seat and a key pickup opportunity to flip the House

Kristen is running for the seat left open by retiring Republican Congressman Dennis Ross, who admitted that he was feeling like a “stranger in (his) hometown” and has been a strong supporter of the destructive Trump agenda. Kristen is the only woman running from either party and would be the first woman elected to represent the 15th District. This is a can’t-miss opportunity to help an outstanding candidate flip an open seat, and Kristen has what it takes to win this fight. Kristen will have the full support of the EMILY’s List community to win this seat and deliver the majority to Democrats.

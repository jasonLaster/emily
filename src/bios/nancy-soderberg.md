## A champion for Florida working families

Nancy is an experienced leader and a lifelong public servant running for Congress to fight for Florida working families. The daughter of a Korean War veteran, she began her career in policy and government with encouragement from her college professor Madeleine Albright.

> Throughout her outstanding career of service, Nancy has worked closely with the White House, the United Nations, and the Senate. She served as the foreign policy director for the Clinton/Gore 1992 campaign and transition team and as senior foreign policy advisor to late Senator Ted Kennedy.

Nancy served as the third ranking official of the National Security Council at the White House as deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs.

President Bill Clinton next appointed her to serve as alternate representative to the United Nations in 1997, with the rank of Ambassador.

> She has over a decade of executive leadership experience in global organizations, and is a powerful advocate for conflict prevention and resolution.

President Barack Obama appointed Nancy to serve as chair of the Public Interest Declassification Board in 2011, and she worked tirelessly to increase transparency in national security decisions.

Nancy currently serves as a **professor of foreign policy** and director of the public service leadership program at the University of North Florida and is **president and CEO of Soderberg Global Solutions**, an international consulting firm.

She is an author, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and serves on the board of advisors to the president of the Naval Postgraduate School and Naval War College.

## A fighter dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Nancy is running to expand economic opportunity for Florida working families and to help create good-paying jobs. At a time when an extreme Republican agenda in Congress threatens to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Nancy is a fierce champion for expanding access to affordable, quality health care — an issue that is deeply personal to her as an American who has carefully managed a pre-existing condition of diabetes for decades. “President Trump’s latest moves — to allow insurers to segregate pools of ‘healthy’ people from those who have pre-existing conditions — will bring us back to the days where even minor or manageable injuries and illnesses become financial catastrophes,” she has said. “Republicans in Congress are no better on this issue, having spent the last seven years trying to end the ACA and put the control of health care back in the hands of insurance accountants.”

## An opportunity to flip an open seat and take back the House

## Nancy is running for an open Republican-held seat after the extreme incumbent she stepped up to challenge, Congressman Ron DeSantis, decided to seek the Florida governorship instead of running for re-election to the House. This is a critical seat in a battleground state, and Nancy has what it takes to win. Let’s show her our full support and help flip this seat send this champion for Florida working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

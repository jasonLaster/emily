## A consumer advocate who knows how to fight

Katie has spent nearly 20 years as a consumer advocate taking on Wall Street banks and powerful financial institutions that try to take advantage of middle-class families. The daughter of a farmer and a teacher, Katie saw firsthand how the farm crisis of the 1980s hurt families and communities. After graduating from Yale University, she went to Harvard Law School and learned bankruptcy law from influential professor Elizabeth Warren, with whom she co-authored a book on debt and credit law.

- She has earned her national acclaim for her fights against unfair practices by Wall Street banks, credit card companies, student loan servicers, and predatory lenders. She was teaching law at the University of California - Irvine and raising her three young children in 2012 when then-Attorney General of California Kamala Harris asked Katie to serve as the California Monitor of the National Mortgage Settlement.

- The five biggest Wall Street banks had promised billions in relief to the homeowners they had cheated, and Katie held the banks' feet to the fire -- securing $18 billion for California homeowners and helping tens of thousands of families in the state. She has worked to bring down credit card fees and is dedicated to ending the predatory banking practices that hurt women and families.

- Katie is running for Congress to get our economy working for all Californians and to fight back against a dangerous agenda that puts powerful interests ahead of people and families. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, now both United States senators, have endorsed Katie’s strong campaign. She lives in Irvine with her three children, where she is a longtime leader in her sons’ Cub Scout pack.

## A champion for California families

Katie is committed to increasing economic opportunity for middle-class families and taking on the special interests that take unfair advantage of those pursuing the American dream. A tenured professor, Katie founded a consumer protection legal clinic at the University of California Irvine. Katie was one of the first people to sound the alarm about Wall Street abuses in the housing market, and when elected she will continue to courageously speak truth to power and hold special interests accountable. Katie knows that we cannot take our natural resources for granted. She will fight back against the climate science deniers in Congress, and will work tirelessly to protect our environment for future generations. Katie is proud to live in a community that finds strength in its diversity, and in Congress she will fight to defend the rights of the most vulnerable among us as they come under attack.

## An opportunity to defeat a vulnerable GOP incumbent

Katie is challenging extreme Rep. Mimi Walters, a vulnerable Republican seeking a third term in a district that Hillary Clinton carried by more than five points in 2016. Walters is in lockstep with President Trump’s dangerous agenda, and Speaker Paul Ryan counts on her support for policies that hurt the women and families she was elected to represent. Walters’ record of failure includes voting in committee to advance the House GOP’s bill that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act (in addition to voting for the bill again on the floor) — and then refusing to hold town hall meetings to face the people she is supposed to be serving. Walters is a top Democratic target in 2018, and the path to taking back the House is through this district — one of our best opportunities to flip a seat. The special interests Walters serves will spend heavily to defend her, but Katie does not back down from a tough fight — especially when so much is at stake. “We need leaders in Congress who will stand up to Donald Trump,” Katie has said. “I’m running to continue the work I’ve always done — to take on the powerful special interests on behalf of our families.” Let’s show Katie the full strength of the EMILY’s List community and help her turn California’s 45th District blue.

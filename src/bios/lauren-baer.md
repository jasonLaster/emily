## A champion for Florida working families

Lauren Baer is a policy expert with an outstanding record of public service running for Congress to fight for Florida working families. She grew up in a family of local business owners who taught her the importance of hard work and giving back. Lauren attended Palm Beach County public schools and went on to earn her bachelor’s degree from Harvard, her law degree from Yale, and her master’s degree from the University of Oxford, where she was a Marshall Scholar.

- She is a powerful advocate for justice and her work as an attorney included an active pro bono practice and taking the fight to get money out of politics all the way to the Supreme Court.
- Lauren served in the Obama administration as a senior advisor to Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.
- She currently serves as a consultant for the global strategy firm founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Lauren and her wife Emily are proud parents of a young daughter and they enjoy spending time outdoors with their dog in their South Florida community.

## A proven leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Lauren is running for Congress to expand economic opportunity by fighting to create jobs, raise wages, and encourage entrepreneurship. “Growing up in a family business where we sold furniture for a living taught me that we are all better off when we are all better off, and that our economy should be strong but also equitable,” she has said. “I’ll be a champion for workers, small business owners, and everyone striving to make ends meet, because every person deserves a fair shot.” Lauren is dedicated to making Florida a hub for new industries, like solar energy, and a place where small businesses can thrive. She is also a powerful advocate for expanding access to quality health care at a time when Republicans are desperate to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. This fight is deeply personal for Lauren, whose mother has been chronically ill for more than 20 years after a serious accident changed their lives forever. She finds inspiration in her mother’s strength. “We want quality, affordable health care,” she has said. “We want good public schools, a clean environment. This campaign is about families, the same people I grew up with here. All they ask for is somebody who actually listens.” When elected, Lauren will give Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast families a new voice in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Lauren is running in Florida’s 18th Congressional District and challenging Republican incumbent Congressman Brian Mast, whose reliable vote for the GOP's disastrous agenda has hurt the working families he was elected to serve. Our path to taking back the House runs right through this swing district, and Lauren has what it takes to win. The contrast is stark and the choice is clear, but Mast’s allies will do everything they can to keep this seat — and Congress — under Republican control. Let’s show Lauren the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Florida working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

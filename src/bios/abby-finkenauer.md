## A tireless champion for Iowa’s working families

Abby Finkenauer is a lifelong Iowan and dedicated public servant running to give working families a new voice in Congress. Growing up in the Northeast Iowa community, Abby’s parents, a union pipefitter welder and a longtime Dubuque Community Schools employee, taught her the importance of hard work and giving back. Abby is the youngest of four siblings who are all proud first-generation college graduates.

- She began her career as a **legislative aide**, and she was just 24 when a mentor encouraged her to run for an open seat in the Iowa House. Abby ran a savvy grassroots campaign, and emerged from a crowded field to win by a wide margin – becoming the third-youngest woman serving in a state legislature in the country.

- She quickly established a reputation as a fighter for working families, and previously served as the Iowa director for **Make It Work**, a nonprofit that advocates for paid family leave and affordable child care. When elected to Congress, Abby will continue her life’s work of fighting to give Iowa’s working families a fair shot.

## A powerful advocate for increasing economic opportunity for all Iowans

Abby is a forward-looking leader focused on increasing economic opportunity for all Iowans. “We can fight for better wages, better education, but also equality and inclusiveness,” she has said. “There’s room for everyone and I’m not going to forget that, and our Democratic Party can once again be a place of hope and champions for all families who deserve a fair shot.” As a product of Iowa’s public schools and a millennial still working to pay off student loans, Abby is a strong advocate for expanding educational opportunity for all Iowa students — and an outspoken critic of Iowa Republicans’ underfunding of public schools. With roots in a blue collar labor family, she is a fierce defender of Iowa workers’ rights. Abby is committed to commonsense policies that give women a fair shot: “I'm not going to ever apologize for fighting for equal pay, affordable child care or paid family leave,” she has said. A pro-choice champion, Abby has spoken out against the GOP’s dangerous priorities throughout her time in the Iowa legislature. “As long as my Republican colleagues continue to focus on going after women and their families, I will continue to fight back,” she has said.

## A swing district with a vulnerable incumbent

Abby is running in Iowa's 1st Congressional District, and this seat is a must-win for Democrats as we fight to take back the House in 2018. Vulnerable incumbent Congressman Rod Blum has been putting special interests ahead of the Iowans he was elected to serve and advancing the extreme Republican agenda at their expense. A member of the extreme Freedom Caucus, Blum voted for the GOP’s bill that would take away health insurance from 23 million Americans, and would hurt thousands of hardworking Iowans. President Trump narrowly won this district in 2016, but approval rating has plummeted there since he took office — and his ally Blum is now faced with defending their shared record of failure in the midterm election. The contrast between out-of-touch Blum and Abby could not be clearer. “I know this district,” she has said. “These are my friends and family. My friends and family aren’t Washington lobbyists. There’s a big difference.” Abby has what it takes to hold Blum accountable to Iowa’s working families and to flip this seat. The Hawkeye State has never before elected a Democratic woman to Congress, and she’s poised to make history as the first. Let’s show this champion for women and families our full support and give hardworking Iowans a new voice in Washington.

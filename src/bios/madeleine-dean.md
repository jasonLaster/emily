Madeleine served as an **assistant professor at La Salle University** for over a decade and then as a **local township commissioner**, writing as a contributor to local daily newspapers along the way.

She was elected to be a **state representative** in 2012 and has served in Harrisburg since then. Madeleine lives in Jenkintown, Abington Township with her husband and has three grown sons and one granddaughter.


## An experienced leader dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Madeleine is running to fight to expand economic opportunity and to help create good-paying jobs for hardworking Pennsylvanians. Since her election to the state House six years ago, Madeleine has been a champion for progressive policies including access to health care, funding for public education, combating gun violence and more. “I have been proud to stand up for working people in Harrisburg […] I want to continue those efforts in Washington,” she has said. Madeleine also serves on the Pennsylvania Commission for Women and advises the governor on policies that affect women, ranging from expanding economic opportunities to supporting mentorship programs. “Montgomery County needs a progressive woman in Congress to shape our American future!” she has said.

## An open seat and a critical Democratic hold in the fight to take back the House

Madeleine is running for a critical redistricted open seat. Pennsylvania currently has the largest congressional delegation that is all men, and when elected, Madeleine will give the millions of Pennsylvania women a new voice in Washington. “We have a Republican-controlled Congress that isn't doing its part to hold Donald Trump accountable,” she has said. With control of the House at stake this year, this race is a must-win for Democrats, and Madeleine is the only candidate who has what it takes to win. Madeleine is a champion for working families and has the full support of the EMILY’s List community.

## A proven fighter for working parents

Liuba Grechen Shirley is a champion for women and families running for Congress to fight for hardworking Long Islanders. A proven advocate, she has dedicated her career to **women’s economic empowerment**. Liuba was raised by a single mother who worked as a public school teacher, and learned the value of hard work and the importance of community from her close- knit family in Amityville.

- She earned her bachelor’s degree at New York University and an MBA from NYU’s Stern School of Business, specializing in social innovation, and is a successful nonprofit leader fighting for working families.

- She recently made national headlines when she became the first woman to get federal approval to use campaign funds for child care, breaking down barriers for women candidates across the country.

- Liuba lives in Amityville with her husband and two young children. When elected, she will continue her life’s work of making the voices of women and families heard in the halls of power.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Liuba is running to expand economic opportunity for all Long Islanders and to help create good- paying jobs that give families and communities the opportunity to thrive. An experienced leader and policy expert, she has led projects for nonprofits like Women Deliver, PL+US: Paid Leave for the US, Vital Voices, Global Health Visions, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and launched the #IAmParent campaign for parental leave with UN Women. Liuba is a powerful advocate for expanding access to affordable, quality health care. She knows firsthand how hard working families struggle to pay medical bills: despite paying high premiums for insurance, she faced thousands of dollars in bills after giving birth to her children and has fought for her mother when doctors refused to take her insurance for major surgeries. “I am running for Congress because we don’t get to choose when we get sick and health care shouldn’t just be reserved for the rich,” she has said. When elected, Liuba will work tirelessly to move our country forward for Long Island working families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Liuba is challenging incumbent Peter King, the longest-serving Republican member of Congress in the state of New York. King has boasted about his willingness to defend Trump’s travel ban and relationship with Russia. This is a district that Obama won in 2012, and an opportunity to defeat a radical Republican to flip this seat. Liuba founded a grassroots group called New York’s 2nd District Democrats to engage Long Islanders in the political process, and she has what it takes to bring her community together and bring new leadership to Long Island. Let’s show her our full support, and help send this champion for working families to Washington to fight for Long Islanders.

## A veteran and advocate for working families

MJ Hegar is an **Air Force combat veteran** running to fight for Texas working families in Congress. Raised in Texas’ Hill Country, MJ grew up dreaming of serving our country as a military pilot. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, she enlisted in the Air Force and began training to fly.

MJ went on to serve three tours in Afghanistan as a **rescue helicopter pilot** until her helicopter was shot down by enemy fire. She was **awarded a Purple Heart** and Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor for her bravery and heroism.

She soon discovered that her options for a ground combat military job were limited because she is a woman. MJ partnered with the ACLU to successfully petition the U.S. Department of Defense to overturn the limitations.

She published a memoir in 2017, and a film adaptation is currently in production. MJ currently lives in Round Rock with her husband, two toddlers, and three stepchildren.


## An advocate for equal opportunity

MJ is a strong advocate for expanding opportunities for women and families. When she learned that she was unable to apply for a military job she wanted after she could no longer be a pilot, MJ set out to change the rules. She spent years traveling back and forth between Texas and Washington, D.C., meeting with policymakers at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill and urging them to take action. MJ was one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU’s lawsuit against the U.S. secretary of defense, who ultimately repealed the combat exclusion policy that had been limiting women’s opportunities for advancement in the military. “I did a lot of good in D.C. fighting to open jobs for women in the military,” she has said. “But there is more to be done. We need to send people to Washington who have change management skills.”

## A new voice ready to fight for Texans in Congress

MJ won her primary and is now facing off against Republican incumbent Rep. John Carter, a Tea Party extremist who hasn’t faced a tough re-election challenge in years. “We must do better for our veterans, families, and seniors,” MJ has said. “Now is the time to come together to win in November and give Texans the present and available representation we deserve and have been sorely missing.” EMILY’s List strongly agrees, and that’s why we’re proud to be standing alongside this accomplished fighter to help her flip this seat.

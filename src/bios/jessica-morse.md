## A dedicated public servant fighting for working families

Jessica Morse is a committed public servant and national security expert who is running to fight for California working families in Congress. A fifth-generation Northern Californian, Jessica’s family continues to manage land that has been in her family since the turn of the 20th century. Her deep roots in the area have spurred her love of the outdoors, inspiring her to hike 500 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail that cover the length of the 4th District. Jessica has served in a variety of national security roles throughout her career, working for both the U.S. Departments of State and Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). She has worked to advance American interests in India and Iraq, among other countries, and is deeply familiar with the federal budget process. Jessica is now prepared to be a voice for Northern Californians in Washington, DC.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity

Jessica is running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for Northern California working families. “I’m running because I want every member of our community to have the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed on their own,” she has said. She plans to advocate for job training programs, support small businesses, and bring reliable internet access to rural communities in the district. Jessica is committed to protecting and expanding access to affordable, quality health care. “I support the goal of universal coverage and a path to get there, including improvements to the ACA and innovative approaches to bringing down the cost of care for everyone,” she has said. As an avid hiker and backpacker who grew up exploring the district’s natural resources, Jessica also plans to fight for environmental policies that benefit the district, including defending public lands and investing in clean energy.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Jessica is running against Republican incumbent Tom McClintock, who, over the course of his decade in office, has lost sight of issues that matter to the people of the 4th District. McClintock has put partisan politics ahead of the people he represents and has voted to take away access to affordable health insurance multiple times. “Taking on Tom McClintock and his special-interest backers will not be easy,” Jessica has said. “But as I have learned […] traveling across all ten counties in the 4th District, nothing can erase the enthusiasm and passion awakened by our campaign.” Let’s show this champion for working families our full-fledged support to flip this seat and help Democrats take back the House.

## A champion for Indiana’s working families

Liz Watson is a fifth-generation Hoosier who is running for Congress to fight for working families in Indiana. “This race is about the kind of future we want for our children and grandchildren,” she has said, “I will never stop fighting for Hoosier families.”

Liz grew up in Bloomington and attended Bloomington public schools and is committed to ensuring every child receives a great public school education. She then went on to college and law school, where as a law student she **helped represent victims of domestic violence**.

Currently a **faculty member at Indiana University**, Liz has spent her career fiercely advocating for women and families, including serving as director of workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center, executive director of the Georgetown Poverty Center, and as the labor policy director for congressional Democrats.

Liz and her husband live near her parents in Bloomington with their two children, who attend the same elementary school that Liz did.

## A dedicated fighter for expanding economic opportunity

Liz is running for Congress to fight for good-paying jobs, affordable health care, strong schools and other policies that help working families get ahead. “I want to represent the people in our district by fighting for better health care, good jobs and the best public education we can provide for our children,” she has said. Liz decided to run when she saw that these values were under attack by House Republicans, including in the recent tax bill they passed that gave large tax cuts to corporations. “Special interests have been manipulating the rules of the economy in favor of the one percent for too long,” she has said. “If we work together, we can restore the American dream for Indiana families.” Liz has a strong record fighting for families throughout her career, and when elected, she will continue to fight tirelessly for them in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Liz is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Trey Hollingsworth, a vulnerable freshman who has prioritized a dangerous and extreme agenda that hurts the working families he was elected to serve. Liz’s strong, grassroots campaign built impressive early momentum, and Hollingsworth is running scared — he literally skipped a town hall with constituents because he was unwilling to defend the GOP’s tax scam. Liz has what it takes to hold him accountable, but Hollingsworth’s deep-pocketed special interest allies are counting on him to support their agenda and won’t give up without a fight because they are desperate to keep his seat and his party’s control of the House. Liz is a fearless fighter for Hoosiers, and she has what it takes to flip this seat. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community so we can take back the House in 2018.

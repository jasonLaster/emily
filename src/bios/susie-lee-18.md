## A fierce champion for Nevada children and families

Susie Lee is a nonprofit leader and education advocate who has dedicated her career to helping her fellow Nevadans lead better, safer, and healthier lives. She is running for Congress to continue her life’s work of bringing people together to find and implement innovative solutions to the toughest problems facing Nevada’s working families.

Susie grew up the sixth of eight children in a working-class community. Susie got her first newspaper route at the age of eight, and began babysitting and lifeguarding as soon as she was old enough. With the help of Pell Grants, student loans, and scholarships, she paid her way through college; working in the cafeteria, the library, the copy room, and teaching aerobics while also competing on the swim team. Susie found mentors who gave her the affirmation and encouragement she needed to succeed as a young woman.

This experience inspired her work as a **nonprofit leader and education advocate**, working tirelessly to ensure that Nevada’s most vulnerable children can turn to their school communities for support when they don’t have resources at home.

Susie has called Southern Nevada home for over two decades, and she and her husband Dan have proudly raised their two teenage children in the diverse and vibrant Silver State.


## An experienced community leader and problem solver

Susie is focused on making a tangible positive impact on the lives of Southern Nevada’s working families, and will work tirelessly to expand educational and economic opportunity for all Americans. “I’m not afraid of rolling up my sleeves,” Susie has said. “I generally don’t take ‘no’ for an answer — I hear ‘not that way.’” Susie has led Communities in Schools of Nevada, serving as president of its board, revitalizing and expanding the nonprofit, which now serves over 60,000 children in more than 60 schools across Nevada. A fierce champion for the students who need one the most, Susie has held the organization and its successful dropout prevention program accountable to the highest standards. Recognizing that many Nevada families struggle with housing insecurity, food insecurity, and other challenges, she helped launch a site coordinator program to give the most vulnerable students a dedicated advocate ensuring their needs are met inside and outside of school. Health care is also a deeply personal issue for Susie. When she was a freshman in college, her father was laid off from his steel manufacturing job and never had another shot at economic security. Her parents couldn’t afford health insurance because of common pre-existing conditions, and when her mother had a heart attack one month before reaching Medicare eligibility the hospital bill was so large they risked losing their house. When elected, Susie will fight to make access to quality health care a right, not a privilege, and she will be a powerful advocate for all Southern Nevadans in Congress.

## A tough fight for a critical hold in a swing district

Susie is running in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, fighting to keep this swing seat blue as EMILY’s List Congresswoman Jacky Rosen vacates it to run for the U.S. Senate. This is expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive House races in the country, and holding the line in this swing district is critical to our success as we fight to take back the House. Republicans, desperate to gain ground anywhere they can, identified this purple district as one of their top targets even before it became an open seat. The GOP is sure to spend heavily to stop us from electing another pro-choice champion to this bellwether Southern Nevada seat. This is sure to be a tough fight, but Susie never backs down from a challenge when so much is at stake — and she has what it takes to win. Let’s show Susie the full support of the EMILY’s List community as she fights to defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make and leads Nevada forward.

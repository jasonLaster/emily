## A champion for Minnesota’s working families

Angie Craig is running for Congress because the opportunities she was lucky enough to have are disappearing for too many working families. Angie grew up in a mobile home park, one of three kids raised by a single mom who worked while going to school to earn her college degree. Angie’s mom taught her that if she worked hard, she could grow up to be anything she wanted to be—and Angie believed her.

Angie worked two jobs to keep up with the cost of her education, and graduated from a state college. She began her career as a **newspaper reporter** then worked her way up in business over fifteen years to eventually lead a workforce of 16,000 employees for a major Minnesota manufacturer.

As a former **Fortune 500 company executive**, Angie has helped create jobs, empowered women and veterans to advance in their careers, and created workplace policies to promote diversity and inclusion. As a leader in the Minnesota business community, Angie has been a powerful advocate for marriage equality in the state.

She and her wife are proud to have raised their four sons in Minnesota and embrace this state’s values of family, community, and caring for each other—values Angie is fighting to bring to Congress.

## A business leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Angie is deeply committed to expanding economic opportunity for all Minnesotans, improving access to health care, and making education affordable. As a business leader at Minnesota-based St. Jude Medical, Angie led a team united by a common goal “to grow the business by serving our patients,” she has said. “I saw firsthand the power of research and development. Our world-class team of scientists and engineers gave us products that literally saved our patients’ lives while boosting the economy.” In Congress, Angie will work tirelessly to grow our economy and create jobs that help hardworking Minnesotans get ahead. She has collaborated with four-year universities, community colleges, and technical schools to ensure that students gained the skills they needed for available good-paying jobs, and will be a fierce advocate for educational opportunity in Congress. When Angie was growing up, her family didn’t always have health insurance, and she saw firsthand how medical bills threatened their economic security. In Congress, she will fight to expand access to affordable quality health care for all.

## A chance to flip a swing seat from red to blue

Angie is running against Jason Lewis, a dangerous Republican extremist who narrowly won this swing seat when Angie ran in 2016. This is a true purple district, and this seat is a must-win for Democrats as we fight to take back the House in 2018. Congressman Lewis was dubbed ‘Minnesota's Mr. Right’ by the local Tea Party, and his radical agenda is out of step with the values of the Minnesotans he was elected to represent. He votes in lockstep with his party’s leaders, serving special interests at the expense of working families, and as a former conservative talk radio host he has an outrageous record of disparaging women and people of color. Lewis has called “a vast majority” of young, single women “non-thinking.” He has criticized natural disaster victims as “a bunch of whiners.” And he equated taxing the wealthiest among us with slavery. Angie is ready to take him on and to fight back against his toxic agenda and rhetoric with her experience, leadership, and Minnesota values. Our country has never before elected an openly lesbian mother to the House, and Angie is poised to give LGBTQ families a new voice in the halls of power. In 2000, Angie’s fight for custody of her adopted son led to a landmark ruling making it possible for other same-sex couples to adopt. She has said “we can’t rest on past successes” when it comes to advancing equality—especially at a time when the Republicans in control of Washington advance an extreme anti-family agenda that threatens to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. Angie has what it takes to flip this seat from red to blue and to help us take back the House. Let’s show her our full support so that hardworking families in the Second District will finally have a representative in Congress who speaks for them.

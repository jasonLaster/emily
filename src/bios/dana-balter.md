## A proven leader fighting for central and western New York working families

Dana Balter is a dedicated community leader running for Congress to fight for central and western New York working families. From a young age, Dana learned how to be a fierce advocate from her parents. Her younger brother has cognitive disabilities, and Dana’s family fought for him to have the same educational opportunities, dignity, and respect that all children deserve.

- She began her career in **special education** at a nonprofit organization serving adults with cognitive disabilities. Dana worked as a teacher and went on to serve as director of education and then director of communications and marketing.
- She earned her master’s degree in public administration and is a Ph.D. candidate at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The granddaughter of Holocaust refugees who made upstate New York their home, Dana was raised to stand up for her community and her values and she is deeply committed to social justice.
- After the 2016 election, she took action as a tireless community organizer working to hold her elected officials accountable. This grassroots leader stepped up to run for the first time and won a competitive primary in June. Dana lives on Syracuse's East Side with her three rescue dogs, and when elected she will continue to fight for all central and western New York working families.


## A champion dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for all

Dana is running to expand economic opportunity for all central and western New York working families and to help create good-paying jobs so that communities can thrive. As a grassroots leader dedicated to her community, she will champion policies that move central and western New York forward for all. At a time when Republicans are desperate to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Dana is committed to fighting back and expanding access to quality health care for all — a fight that is deeply personal to her. Shortly after beginning her Ph.D. program, Dana faced a debilitating medical condition and had to suspend her studies. She researched her options and approached her treatments with the same determination and grit she brings to every fight, and made a recovery that made it possible for her to return to graduate school. Dana is running to make central and western New York working families’ voices heard, and when elected she will be their fierce champion in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue

Dana is challenging incumbent Republican John Katko, whose record of failure has hurt the working families he was elected to serve. Our path to taking back the House runs right through this district where Hillary Clinton narrowly outperformed Donald Trump in 2016. Dana has what it takes to win, but Katko’s deep-pocketed special interest allies will do everything they can to keep this seat — and Congress — under Republican control. Let’s show Dana the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for central and western New York working families to Congress, and let’s take back the House.

## A constitutional law expert fighting for working families

Carolyn Long is a fighter for working families running for Congress in Washington State. She grew up in a rural coastal community where her mother worked as a waitress and her father worked odd jobs and started a small produce business, and Carolyn started working at the store when she was 12 years old to help her family make ends meet. She worked her way through college with a good union job at a grocery store and went on to earn her **Ph.D. in political science**.

While Carolyn was in graduate school, her family purchased a small organic farm and she returned home to help every summer. An **accomplished professor** who has written two books on constitutional law, she has worked at Washington State University Vancouver for more than two decades as a tenured professor and in administrative and leadership positions.

She lives in Vancouver with her husband and their daughter, and after years of teaching students about American institutions, public law, American public policy, and public civility she is running for office for the first time to stand up for Washington State working families and to defend our American values as they come under attack like never before.


## A strong leader dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Carolyn is running to expand economic opportunity for Washington State working families. She has personal experience helping her family grow their small business and is dedicated to helping entrepreneurs innovate and create good-paying jobs that help all Washington State communities thrive. As a proud former journeyman with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555 union, she also knows firsthand how critical unions are to growing our middle class. “Unions make America strong,” Carolyn has said. She is a powerful advocate for infrastructure investment and growing apprenticeships and other training programs that give Washington Staters the skills they need to succeed in a changing economy. Carolyn is a pro-choice champion committed to expanding access to quality health care for all, and when elected she will fight back against Republicans’ attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Carolyn is challenging Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, who has been working to advance the GOP’s agenda that hurts the working families she was elected to serve. Herrera Beutler has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to defund Planned Parenthood, and has avoided facing the Washington State families she represents in person at town hall meetings. Carolyn has what it takes to hold her accountable and win in November. Let’s show this champion for working families our full support and help her flip this seat — and let’s take back the House.

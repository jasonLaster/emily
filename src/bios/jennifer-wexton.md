## An experienced leader fighting for Virginia's working families

Jennifer Wexton is an experienced leader and advocate for justice who is running to fight for Virginia’s working families in Congress. Currently a state senator, Jennifer has previously served Loudon County as a substitute judge, special justice, and assistant commonwealth’s attorney. She successfully prosecuted and tried cases ranging from criminals who committed domestic violence to misdemeanor traffic cases. In the state Senate, she has passed over 40 bills in the last four years she’s been in office, proving herself to be an effective bipartisan legislator. Jennifer is a Washington-area native who lives in Leesburg with her husband, two sons, and two rescued labrador retrievers.

## A champion for expanding economic opportunity and justice for all

Jennifer is dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for Northern Virginia families. As a state senator, she has been involved in the successful efforts to expand Medicaid to about 400,000 Virginians who previously didn’t qualify. “I would like everyone to have access to affordable, quality health care,” she has said. Jennifer has built bipartisan support in the state Senate for important legislation, including laws that have empowered victims of revenge porn, made online pedophiles easier to prosecute, and secured a woman’s right to breastfeed in public. “I’ve had a strong record of bipartisan legislation that I’ve managed to pass, things that help kids and families in the district, and that’s the same thing I’ll do in Congress,” she has said. As a former prosecutor and judge, Jennifer is committed to justice and equality for all Virginians. These values and her strong work ethic will guide her to be a vocal advocate for working families in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a critical swing seat

Jennifer is running against vulnerable Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock, whose conservative beliefs and votes do not align with the district that she represents. “Barbara Comstock has worked to strip health care from millions of Americans, proudly touts her A rating from the NRA, and is so out of touch with this district that she hides from her constituents,” Jennifer has said, “We are now on a mission to bring real representation to Northern Virginia.” Hillary Clinton won this district by 10 points in 2016, making it one of the most important seats to flip in our fight to take back the House for Democrats. EMILY’s List and our community of supporters are excited to work closely with Jennifer to win this Northern Virginia seat in November.

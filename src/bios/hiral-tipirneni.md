## A doctor, problem solver, and champion for Arizona working families

Dr. Hiral Tipirneni is a doctor, a health care advocate, and a dedicated community leader running for Congress to fight for Arizona working families.

- A proud immigrant, Hiral’s parents brought her to the United States from India when she was three years old in pursuit of the American dream. Her father worked as a structural engineer, and her mother, a social worker, served as director of a local senior center and started its Meals on Wheels program and taught Hiral the value of community service.

- Her own experience with typhoid fever as a child inspired Hiral to earn her medical degree, and she went on to pursue a career in emergency medicine to put her passion for problem-solving, teamwork, and patient care into action.

- After serving as chief resident of the University of Michigan’s Emergency Medicine program, Hiral and her husband, an orthopedic surgeon, chose to make their home and raise a family in Phoenix. She has served her community practicing emergency medicine at local hospitals, and after losing her mother and nephew to cancer, she turned her professional focus to cutting-edge cancer research.

- A community leader and innovation advocate, Hiral serves on the boards of local nonprofits. She and her husband have raised their three children in the Arrowhead community.

## A leader fighting to expand economic opportunity

Hiral is running to expand economic opportunity for Arizona working families and to help create good-paying jobs in the Northwest Valley so that communities can thrive. “America gave my family a chance to rise and thrive, the very reasons that brought us to the United States in the first place,” she has said. “I passionately believe that we must remain a land of opportunity for those who are willing to work for it.” As an experienced medical doctor, Hiral is dedicated to expanding Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care, and she will fight back against any attempt to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. A leader in her field, Hiral brings together researchers, clinicians, and patient advocates in the fight to treat and cure breast cancer, prostate cancer, and childhood leukemia. When elected, she will bring new leadership to Congress and move Arizona forward for hardworking families.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Hiral is challenging Rep. Debbie Lesko, the vulnerable Republican who took office after an April special election for the vacant seat in Arizona's 8th Congressional District that Republican Congressman Trent Franks resigned amidst serious allegations that he sexually harassed women staffers. Hiral ran a strong campaign in the special election, and Lesko only won by a narrow margin even though the GOP poured money into what should have been a safe seat easy to defend.  The stakes are even higher in November, and Hiral has what it takes to win this rematch and help take back the House. This is a district that has never before elected a woman of color to Congress, and she is poised to be the first. Let’s show Hiral our full support, and help send this champion for Arizona working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

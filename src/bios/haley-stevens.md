## A former public servant who helped lead Michigan's auto recovery and saved thousands of jobs

Haley Stevens is a leader in advanced manufacturing and a former public servant running for Congress to continue her fight for Michigan working families. As the daughter of a CEO mother and public school teacher father who started a small business together, Haley knows what it takes to work hard and make a difference.

> She served as a political appointee under President Obama, serving as chief of staff for the Treasury Department’s Auto Task Force and as a special advisor for the Department of Commerce. 

Haley played a key role in restoring the financial stability of the auto industry and _helped save thousands of Michigan jobs during the recession_.

She worked tirelessly to help set up the Office of Recovery for Automotive Communities and Workers and the White House Office of Manufacturing Policy, federal offices that contributed to the creation of new jobs for hardworking Michiganders.

Born and raised in Oakland County, she is a proud resident of Rochester Hills and has most recently led a national workforce development program and launched a STEM education initiative for middle and high school students.

## A leader dedicated to creating Great Lake State jobs

Haley is running to expand economic opportunity for all Michiganders and fighting to create good-paying jobs that will help Southeastern Michigan communities thrive. As chief of staff to President Obama’s auto rescue, she helped save thousands of jobs and strengthened Michigan’s advanced manufacturing economy. Haley has worked to create advanced manufacturing job opportunities in southeastern Michigan, and she created the country’s first online certification program for digital manufacturing. She has a proven record of fiercely defending and expanding Michiganders’ economic opportunities, and when elected she will champion policies that create more good-paying jobs. Haley is a powerful advocate for expanding access to quality health care at a time when Republicans are desperate to undo the progress we have worked so hard to make. “Health care is a right,” she has said, and she is a pro-choice champion. When elected, Haley will fight tirelessly to defend our progress and to lead the Great Lakes State forward for all Michiganders.

## An opportunity to flip an open seat from red to blue

Haley is running in Michigan’s 11th Congressional District for a seat left open by retiring Republican incumbent David Trott, whose reliable vote for the GOP's disastrous agenda has hurt the working families he was elected to serve. Our path to taking back the House runs right through this toss-up district where Donald Trump narrowly won in 2016, and Haley has what it takes to win. She faces Republican nominee Lena Epstein, an enthusiastic Trump supporter who helped engineer his 2016 upset in Michigan, and Haley is holding her accountable for the GOP’s record of failing Michigan working families. The contrast is stark and the choice is clear, but Epstein’s allies will do everything they can to keep this seat — and Congress — under Republican control. Let’s show Haley the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Michigan working families to Congress, and let’s take back the House.

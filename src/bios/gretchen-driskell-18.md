## An experienced leader fighting for Michigan

Gretchen Driskell is a dedicated public servant running for Congress to fight for Michigan working families. The daughter and granddaughter of Navy veterans and a Navy mom, Gretchen’s family taught her the importance of serving others. She made Saline, Michigan her home over 25 years ago, and immediately got to work serving the community by helping in the effort to build a community center to bring neighbors together.

- As a former accountant and businesswoman, Gretchen ran for an open city council seat to help revitalize the local economy. After six years of service on the city council, Gretchen became the first woman ever elected **mayor of Saline** – a position she held for 14 years, making her Saline’s longest serving mayor.

- Gretchen worked tirelessly to strengthen public schools and to improve quality of life for working families, including helping to start a farmers market and a youth council. She was elected to the **Michigan state House** in 2012, and served two terms working to expand economic opportunity in the Great Lakes State. She is a proud mother of three, a grandmother of one, and a resident of Saline, Michigan.

## A champion for Michigan’s hardworking families

Gretchen’s experience as a businesswoman and public servant makes her a powerful advocate for policies that will expand economic opportunity and help create good paying jobs. She will work tirelessly to strengthen Michigan schools and increase access to job training programs that create economic opportunity for all. The challenges Michigan working families face are deeply personal for Gretchen, who raised her three children as a single mom who worked multiple jobs and struggled to make ends meet. Prior to being elected to the state legislature, she had been without health insurance for ten years. When elected, Gretchen will fiercely defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make. She will fight tirelessly to increase access to affordable health care — and she will fight back against the dangerous extremists trying to take it away. Gretchen is a pro-choice champion. When Michigan women’s access to reproductive health care was under attack from radical Republicans in the state House, Gretchen fearlessly fought back. “All Michigan residents deserve access to the care they need,” she has said. Gretchen is a champion for hardworking families, and when elected, she will fight tirelessly for them in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat

Gretchen is challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Tim Walberg, an extremist who has spent his time in Washington working to advance a dangerous agenda that hurts the Michigan families he was elected to serve. He has prioritized taking health care away from working families and giving tax breaks to the ultra-rich at the expense of the middle class. Gretchen has what it takes to hold him accountable, but Walberg’s deep-pocketed special interest allies are counting on him to support their agenda and won’t give up without a fight. Democrats must flip seats like this in 2018 to take back the House, and Gretchen is running a strong grassroots campaign to fight for Michiganders. Let’s show Gretchen our full support, and help elect this champion for working families to Congress — and let’s take back the House.

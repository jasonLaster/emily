## A champion for South Florida working families

Mary Barzee Flores is a dedicated public servant running for Congress to fight for Miami's working families. Mary’s father, a World War II veteran who managed a local fish and tackle store, and her mother, a registered nurse who was an Air Force officer in the Korean War, raised Mary and her brother and sister just outside of Little Havana, and all three siblings attended Miami-Dade public schools.

She started working at the age of 15, one year after her father passed away, and worked as a dishwasher, a maid, a cook, and a bartender as a young woman to help her family make ends meet. Mary worked her way through the University of Miami and went on to the University of Miami School of Law — beginning her lifelong passion for service and justice.

> She served in the federal Office of the Public Defender in Miami for twelve years. In 2002, Mary stepped up to run for an open seat as a Florida Circuit Court Judge.

After nearly eight years on the Circuit Court, Mary retired and went into private practice until just a few years later, when _President Obama nominated her for a judgeship on the U.S. District Court_ — but Senator Marco Rubio, citing two small donations she made to the ACLU and to EMILY’s List in the 1990s, blocked her getting a fair hearing in the Senate judiciary committee, much less a vote.

Mary and her husband, Hector, live in Coral Gables, and are the proud parents of two children.

## A fighter ready to bring new leadership to Congress

Mary stepped up to run and to fight for the working families of Miami-Dade County after the 2016 election inspired her to be the candidate she knew her community needed. When elected, she will fight tirelessly to expand economic opportunity and to help create good paying jobs for hardworking Floridians. She is a fierce advocate for access to health care, and she will defend the progress we’ve worked so hard to make at a time when Republicans are desperate to undo as much of it as possible. Mary is a pro-choice champion who will fight to protect women's access to reproductive health care — and she will fight back against any attempts to turn back the clock on women’s rights. Mary is proud to live, work, and send her children to public schools in a community rich with diversity, and when elected she will fight for common sense immigration reform that keeps families together and strengthens our communities and our economy. As a lifelong resident of South Florida, Mary knows the threat that climate change poses to our environment, our economy, and the economic security of working families. When elected, Mary will fight tirelessly to protect South Florida’s unique natural environment for future generations of residents and visitors to come.

## A champion for California working families

Julia Brownley was drawn to public service when she joined her local PTA to improve the school her daughter, Hannah, and her son, Fred, were attending. She went on to run for her local school board, served as school board president, and became one of California’s leading education advocates.

- Julia has helped increase student performance in local schools, fought for more resources in classrooms, given schools more local control, and worked to ensure that every student has a quality teacher, making sure all California students get a fair shot.
- She successfully ran for state Assembly in 2006 and served three terms fighting for women and families, earning a reputation as an effective and hardworking legislator.
- In 2012 Julia ran for Congress in California’s 26th Congressional District, and won a tough election in the state’s new top-two primary system – becoming the first Democrat to represent Ventura County in 70 years.

## A fighter for expanding economic opportunity

Julia is a fierce advocate for expanding economic opportunity and creating good-paying jobs for hardworking Californians. She has dedicated her life to improving California’s schools, colleges, and universities so that all Golden State students have the opportunity to succeed in tomorrow’s economy. Julia believes it is a moral and economic imperative that we fix our broken health care system and ensure access to affordable, quality health care for all Californians. A longtime advocate for health care reform, Julia fought in the California assembly to protect Californians from rising premiums that too often pushed quality health care out of reach for working families. She is a strong advocate for women, a leader in preventing domestic violence, and a pro-choice champion fighting to ensure health insurance companies cover contraception, prenatal, and preventive care for everyone. She is also a champion for our veterans, introducing the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act — legislation requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to identify mental health care and suicide prevention programs that are the most effective and result in the best outcomes among at-risk women veterans — which won overwhelming bipartisan support. “We can and we must do more to address the epidemic of suicide among our women veterans,” Julia has said.

## A must-win race in the fight for control of the House

Julia is running in a swing district where California’s top-two open primary system makes elections unpredictable. The 26th District is a perennial battleground, and it’s a top target for Republican takeover once again in 2018 as the GOP fights hard to flip it back and retain control of the House. The field of her potential challengers includes actor Antonio Sabato Jr., a dangerous extremist and Trump ally who is an outspoken proponent of building a border wall. In stark contrast, “I join millions of Americans across the country who stand firm in the resolve that our nation will be one that works for everyone — a stronger, inclusive America built around uplifting and empowering all of its citizens,” Julia has said — and we need her right where she is, continuing to fight for all California working families in the House. Julia is an alumna of the EMILY’s List Political Opportunity Program, first earning the support of the EMILY’s List community when she ran for a seat in the California state Assembly. Now, as this tough, experienced leader fights to defend a critical seat that’s a must-win for Democrats’ efforts to take back the majority, EMILY’s List is proud to stand with Julia as she continues to fight for California’s hardworking families.

## An inspiring first generation American leader

Stephanie Murphy is running for re-election to continue her fight to expand economic and educational opportunities for all. _Stephanie was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam_. After the fall of Saigon, she’s said, “Families associated with the South Vietnamese and American governments, like my own, were at risk of being sent to re-education camps and subjected to forced labor, torture, starvation and disease.”

When she was just six months old, her family escaped Vietnam on a tugboat that ran out of fuel, leaving them stranded on the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy rescued them and helped them reach a refugee camp in Malaysia, from which Stephanie’s family ultimately immigrated to Virginia with the help of a local church.

> After graduation, Stephanie began a career in the private sector until the events of September 11th motivated her to pursue a career in public service and to earn a master’s degree from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.

She served as a **national security specialist** in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where she received numerous awards, including the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Civilian Service, and she has served as a term **member of the Council on Foreign Relations**. Stephanie re-entered the private sector when she moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she still lives today with her husband Sean and their two young children, Liem and Maya. She worked as an executive and taught finance and social entrepreneurship at Rollins College before successfully running to flip a seat and represent Florida’s 7th Congressional District.

## A national security expert helping Floridians get a fair shot

“America’s greatness is not an abstract concept to me,” Stephanie has said. “I didn’t discover it from words on a page or lyrics in an anthem. My patriotism is the product of a life lesson instilled by U.S. service members who showed grace to desperate strangers at a time when they needed it most.” As a former national security specialist with experience working on counterterrorism issues, Stephanie is committed to confronting threats abroad without undermining our values. After Donald Trump issued his executive order on immigration, she spoke out strongly in opposition, arguing that it would only serve to “violate fundamental American values and undermine our national security. We must work,” she said, “in a bipartisan manner to strengthen our refugee policy in a way that keeps us secure and upholds our values.” Stephanie has called education “the single biggest factor changing the course” of her life, and is deeply committed to expanding access to education for all. As a business executive and educator, Stephanie cares deeply about growing Florida’s economy and creating jobs to help working families get ahead. One of the first pieces of legislation that she cosponsored in Congress was a bill to support entrepreneurship among women scientists. Stephanie is pro-choice and firmly committed to fighting to protect a woman’s right to make her own reproductive health care decisions, and will fight back against the GOP’s dangerous attempts to roll back Americans’ access to the health care they need.

## A rising star targeted for a tough re-election challenge

Stephanie is a rising star in the Democratic Party. She has an invaluable combination of personal and professional experience and expertise that we simply can’t afford to lose in Congress. As we face some of the biggest challenges we’ve ever faced as a country, we need Stephanie right where she is, using her unique voice and perspective to advocate for women and families. In 2016, Stephanie ran in a newly-drawn district evenly split between Democrats and Republicans following court-ordered redistricting. She ran a strong grassroots campaign, and incumbent Republican Rep. John Mica found himself vulnerable after more than two decades of advancing an extreme agenda in Congress and taking his once-safe Republican district for granted. Stephanie flipped this seat to bring new leadership to Washington in what the Orlando Sentinel called a “stunning upset,” but the 7th District is now a top target for Republican takeover in 2018 and the GOP is fighting hard to flip it back. We know Stephanie has what it takes to build and run a strong, winning campaign, but with margins this close in her district, she needs our continued support to fend off a Republican challenge. Let’s show her the full strength of the EMILY’s List community — now more than five million members strong — and show her that we have her back as she fights for our values every day.

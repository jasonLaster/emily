## An experienced leader fighting for Montanans

Kathleen Williams is an experienced leader and fighter on behalf of Montana’s working families. As a **three-term state representative**, Kathleen gained respect from colleagues on both sides of the aisle and distinguished herself as an ethical, effective legislator.

Serving as _vice chair of the agriculture committee_, she emphasized the importance of local farming initiatives in Montana and used her expertise on rivers to inform decisions to protect Montanans’ water rights.

Kathleen also served as _vice chair of the House taxation committee_, where she saw the importance of tax reform that helps expand economic opportunities for working families.

She has also worked as an associate director at the Western Landowners Alliance, where she focused on water and conservation policy issues.

Kathleen enjoys fishing, hunting, canoeing, and cycling in Montana’s beautiful wilderness, which she wants to protect for public use. She has two grown step-sons and a German wirehair pointer named Danni.

## A champion for expanding health care and economic opportunity

Kathleen is running for Congress because she cares deeply about protecting Montanans’ health care and expanding economic opportunity. While she was in the legislature, Kathleen helped shepherd the passage of a bill that sought to ensure cancer patients are treated fairly by health insurers and able to participate in clinical trials that could lead to breakthroughs in treatment. She has released a detailed health policy plan that she will work to pass in Congress. “When I talk to people, health care is absolutely [number one]. If we didn’t have the political will before, we better get it, because we have to fix this,” she has said. Part of Kathleen’s commitment to improving health care comes from the fact that she served as a caregiver for her ailing mother when she was only 11 years old. “I know how an illness can affect a family – it’s hard. We need to make sure every family has health care,” she has said.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and flip the House

Kathleen won a crowded primary to face off against freshman incumbent Rep. Greg Gianforte, who should not only be considered dangerous because of his extreme views on health care and public lands, but also because he pleaded guilty to physically assaulting a reporter on the campaign trail during his special election. This is an opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue and help Democrats win back the House. Kathleen would be the first woman to represent Montana in Congress since the 1940s. “I had a lot of women say they were not sure a woman could win in Montana, and after a while I got blunt: ‘Well, it won’t happen if that’s what we think!’” she has said. Let’s show this champion for Montanans the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help her win this race.

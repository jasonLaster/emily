## An experienced leader and champion for working families

Lisa Brown is an experienced leader and dedicated public servant running for Congress to fight for Washington State working families. Lisa is a first-generation college graduate who moved to Spokane, Washington in 1981 to serve as an associate professor of economics at Eastern Washington University.

- She became deeply involved in her community and worked tirelessly to make it a better place where all working families could thrive, petitioning to increase access to dental care and organizing the city’s first “Take Back The Night” rally to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault.

- She ran for office for the first time in 1992, and served in the state House for three terms before going on to serve in the state Senate for over 15 years. In 2005, Lisa became the **first Democratic woman to serve as Senate majority leader** in the history of Washington State, and she has a proven record of fighting to move the state forward and getting results for the hardworking people she serves.

- Under Lisa’s leadership, the Washington State Senate broke through gridlock to pass landmark legislation, including marriage equality, mental health insurance parity, the expansion of children's health care, and the creation of the nonprofit Prescription Drug Assistance Foundation.

- Most recently, Lisa has served as **chancellor of Washington State University Spokane** and led the development of a new medical school and research programs that have grown eastern Washington’s economy and increased working familes’ access to health care. She and her husband Brian live in Spokane and share a commitment to serving the community they are proud to call home.

## A fighter dedicated to expanding economic opportunity

Lisa is a fighter running for Congress to expand economic opportunity for eastern Washington working families and to help create good-paying jobs. At a time when Republicans in Congress are attempting to undo all the progress we’ve worked so hard to make, Lisa will fight back and continue her lifelong fight to expand access to quality, affordable health care. She is a trailblazer who will give working families a new voice in Washington and put an end to the agenda that makes it harder to get ahead. Lisa is committed to breaking down the barriers to opportunity that working parents face every day. During her first year in office, as the single mother of a 1-year-old, Lisa had to choose between missing work and taking her son home from daycare when a session ran late without a dinner break. She brought him into the chamber and continued to work as he rested, but a colleague complained — citing a policy that previously hadn’t been applied to fathers — and she was asked to remove her son. When elected, Lisa will be a firece advocate for Washington State working families in Congress.

## An opportunity to flip a seat and take back the House

Lisa is challenging vulnerable Republican incumbent Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, an extremist who has worked to advance her party’s dangerous agenda that hurts the working families she was elected to serve. Lisa’s strong grassroots campaign has quickly gained momentum, and this race is a must-win opportunity to flip a seat as we fight to take back the House. McMorris Rodgers is out of touch with eastern Washington working families, and Lisa has what it takes to hold her accountable for her record of failure to bring new leadership to this district. Let’s show Lisa our full support and help flip this seat and send this champion for Washington State to Congress — and take back the House.
